// Vitest sizes its client worker pool from `os.availableParallelism()` when the
// config pins nothing — 128 workers on this box. A single suite survives that,
// but quay never runs a single suite: every task worker runs scripts/test.sh as
// one of its own judging criteria, and fan-in runs it again, so several ~128-way
// pools overlap. They oversubscribe Vite's module server and workers die
// mid-run, surfacing as `STACK_TRACE_ERROR` and `Timeout calling "fetch"` — at
// the reporter layer those are indistinguishable from real test failures, and a
// different subset of files goes red each run.
//
// So bound the pool, adaptively rather than at a fixed width: half the cores
// (a small machine is never asked for more workers than it has) and never more
// than 8. Measured on this box: 4.97s uncapped, 7.53s at 8 workers, 13.43s at 4
// — 8 costs almost nothing and leaves headroom for the concurrent suites.

// Per-worker V8 heap ceiling (gap-vitest-worker-heap-limit). The cgroup cap in
// scripts/with-memory-cap.sh is LAYERED ON TOP of this, not replaced by it: the two bound
// different channels. `--max-old-space-size` bounds only the JS heap, so a runaway that
// retains objects dies in seconds inside its worker; a runaway that grows Buffer/external/
// native memory instead is invisible to it and still needs the cgroup.
//
// Why this exists at all: the cgroup cap only covers the two entry points that opt into the
// wrapper (`npm run test:client`, scripts/test.sh). A bare `npx vitest run` — which is what
// the 2026-09-25 incident actually was — bypasses it entirely, and a config-layer ceiling
// applies to every entry point instead: npx, npm run, test.sh, editor integrations.
//
// 4352 MB is MEASURED, not guessed: `npx vitest run --logHeapUsage` over the whole client
// suite (103 files, 725 cases) reads a per-file maximum of 1401 MB
// (src/shared/asr/tests/asrContractInvariants.test.ts); the next file is 561 MB. 4352 is
// 3.11x that maximum — above the 3x floor this ceiling was specified with, and the tightest
// value above it, so the ceiling stays as close to real usage as the criterion allows.
// Re-derive it after a suite change by reading the same measurement back:
//   npx vitest run --logHeapUsage 2>&1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+ MB heap used' | sort -n | tail -5
// The value belongs above 3x the new maximum — 4352 is the tightest one above 3.11x. This
// number is a policy choice that a human has to make, so it is written down here rather
// than recomputed at runtime: deriving it live would put a full suite run inside every
// `vitest run`.
//
// Note what this is NOT: it is not a cap on the machine's memory use, and it is barely below
// Node's own default `heap_size_limit` here (4288 MB on this 246 GB box). Its job is to make
// the failure FAST and ATTRIBUTABLE, not to make it small.
//
// QUAY_VITEST_HEAP_MB overrides it; `off` (or `0`) adds no argument at all, which is the
// unguarded control the falsification mode of the check script needs.
