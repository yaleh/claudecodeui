/**
 * The FIFTH recogniser adapter: SenseVoice-Small int8, RUN IN THE BROWSER, on onnxruntime-web's WASM
 * backend. It is the first recogniser in this registry whose engine is on the recording device.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM EVERY ROW ABOVE IT, said first because the rest of the file follows.
 * The three HTTP adapters send bytes to a service; `sensevoice-local` sends them down a pipe to a
 * Python process on this host. This one sends them NOWHERE: the model runs in the user's own tab, so
 * the audio never leaves the device at all — which is why it declares `locality: 'local-client'`
 * rather than `'local-server'`. The distinction is not cosmetic: a caller deciding whether a private
 * recording may be uploaded reads `locality` and nothing else, and folding "the browser runs it" into
 * "this host runs it" would make that decision answer about a machine the audio never reaches.
 *
 * SO THIS MODULE OWNS AN INSTALLABLE PORT AND NOT A TRANSPORT. `installWasmEngine` is where a host
 * hands this module the thing that can actually run the model — the browser composition root, whose
 * implementation posts to a Web Worker (`@/modules/chat/audio/voiceClientAsrWorker`), in the shipping
 * client, a fake in a test. `fetchImpl` is never called; that is a reading the contract board takes
 * (`requests=0`) rather than an omission. With nothing installed the adapter still ANSWERS, reporting
 * `ENGINE_UNAVAILABLE` — the same stable code a browser that cannot run the runtime gets. That is the
 * seam's existing fail-closed rule applied one level down, to the engine: no silent substitution, and
 * in particular no quiet routing of the audio to a server the user did not choose.
 *
 * WHY IT REGISTERS NO `runtime`/`ensureRuntime`, WHEN `sensevoice-local` REGISTERS BOTH. Those two
 * fields answer "is this recogniser's runtime ready" for the SERVER, off the health payload. This
 * recogniser's runtime is a property of the CLIENT's browser — a different device for every user of
 * the same deployment — so a server-side reading of it would be a claim about a machine that server
 * cannot see. The browser answers for itself (`useVoiceAvailable`, off the client engine's own
 * status), and the settings form's single "the local engine" row stays unambiguous. The two exported
 * accessors below are therefore NOT registered on the adapter object; they are for the client's
 * composition root, which is the only party that can truthfully answer them.
 *
 * WHY THE TWO GUARDS STILL RUN, AND RUN FIRST. An unaccepted container and an over-budget request are
 * refused before the engine is consulted, exactly as every other adapter refuses them. They are the
 * seam's own rules about what it will hand a recogniser, not properties of a wire, so an adapter that
 * speaks no wire does not get to skip them — and the board measures that it did not.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IMPORTS NOTHING FROM NODE. It is compiled by BOTH compiler configurations (the root
 * one, for the browser's direct path, and `server/tsconfig.json`, because the server publishes this
 * row on its health payload), so it may use no Node built-in, no DOM global and no ES2021+ library
 * feature. Everything that needs a runtime — the model bytes, the WASM runtime, the Cache API — is on
 * the far side of the port, which is why the port is a TYPE and not an import.
 *
 * WHAT THE DECLARATION SAYS, and each field is a claim the invariant board holds the result to:
 *   · `tokens: { confidence: true, timestamps: true }` — the CTC decoder's log-softmax gives a
 *     probability per emitted token and the frame index gives its time, so this adapter returns a
 *     token list and the board checks every confidence is in `(0, 1]` and every time is finite and
 *     non-negative.
 *   · `locality: 'local-client'` — the audio never leaves the recording device. The promise the whole
 *     feature exists for.
 *   · no `credentials` — there is no address and no key to store, so the settings form renders no
 *     credential block for it. That is the declaration the form reads, not a branch in the form.
 *   · `meta.buildId` — what the browser produced is a property of the ARTIFACTS (the ort-web build,
 *     the pinned checkpoint, this front end's version), not of a service, so every result names them
 *     and a reading taken on one build can be told apart from a reading taken on another.

/**
 * This provider's capability declaration.
 *
 * THE TWO CONTAINER-SIDE FIELDS ARE THIS SEAM'S OWN CEILINGS rather than a service's published ones.
 * `maxInlineRequestBytes` bounds what this seam will hold in memory and hand to a recogniser; 32 MiB
 * is the same figure `sensevoice-local` declares, because the constraint is the same one — the bytes
 * are not uploaded anywhere, and the bound that matters is the one past which holding the whole
 * recording is a denial of service of its own. `acceptsMime` is the same audio family the other local
 * recogniser accepts, for the same reason: the front end decodes the container into PCM itself, so
 * the list is the set of containers the recorder and the file picker produce rather than a limit of
 * the model's.
 *
 * `honors` IS ALL FALSE BECAUSE THE MODEL HAS NO SUCH INPUTS. SenseVoice takes audio and nothing else
 * — there is no prompt, no language hint the decoder can be steered by, and no context to bias
 * towards. A caller's hint put on a wire would be a promise nothing downstream keeps, and for this
 * adapter there is not even a wire to put it on: a hint that changed the bytes the engine is handed
 * would be the module inventing an input the model does not have.
 *
 * `transport: 'direct'` rather than `'proxy-only'`, for the reason `sensevoice-local` gives: that
 * field asks which NETWORK path reaches a recogniser, and a recogniser with no address is not
 * restricted to a service-owned one. Declaring `'proxy-only'` would claim an `allowedBaseUrl` rule
 * this module has nothing to write, which is the pairing the seam's own criterion rejects.
 *
 * `pauseCues: 'destructive'` FOLLOWS FROM WHERE THE AUDIO COMES FROM. This adapter is handed the
 * audio the client's trim already removed pauses from — the same segments the other providers
 * receive — so the pauses are gone before the model sees the bytes. Recording the setting the
 * CALLER applied, rather than one this module chose, is what stops a reader of the declaration from
 * concluding the module spent a punctuation cue it never had.
