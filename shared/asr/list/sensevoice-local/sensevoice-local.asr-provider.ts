/**
 * The FOURTH recogniser adapter: SenseVoice-Small on this host, through a patched sherpa-onnx.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT WIRED LIKE THE OTHER THREE, said first because everything else in this file
 * follows from it. The three adapters before this one are HTTP clients: `transcribe` builds a
 * request out of `AsrInvocation`'s `baseUrl`, `apiKey` and `model` and reads an answer back off the
 * injected `fetchImpl`. This one speaks to no endpoint at all. Its recogniser is a Python process
 * on the same machine, running a *patched* sherpa-onnx build whose CTC log-probabilities are what
 * makes per-token confidence possible, and the socket between the two is a pipe rather than a URL.
 * `fetchImpl` is never called, which is a reading the contract board takes rather than an omission.
 *
 * SO THE ADAPTER OWNS AN INSTALLABLE PORT, NOT A TRANSPORT. `installSensevoiceEngine` is where a
 * host hands this module the thing that can actually run the model — the process manager in
 * `server/modules/voice/sensevoice-worker.ts` in the shipping deployment, a fake in a test. When
 * nothing has been installed the adapter still ANSWERS rather than throwing: it reports
 * `ENGINE_UNAVAILABLE`, which is the same stable code a deployment with a missing model directory
 * gets. That is the fail-closed rule this seam already keeps for provider ids — no silent
 * substitution — applied one level down, to the engine.
 *
 * THE TWO GUARDS STILL RUN, AND THEY RUN FIRST. An unaccepted container and an over-budget request
 * are refused before the engine is consulted, exactly as the OpenAI-compatible adapter refuses them
 * before it builds a multipart body. They are not properties of a wire — they are the seam's own
 * rules about what it will hand a recogniser — so an adapter that speaks no wire does not get to
 * skip them, and the board measures that it did not.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IMPORTS NOTHING FROM NODE. It is compiled by BOTH compiler configurations (the root
 * one, for the browser's direct path, and `server/tsconfig.json`), so it may use no Node built-in
 * and no ES2021+ library feature. Every environment dependency is therefore injected: the port
 * above supplies the model, and `transcribe` reads only what the contract hands it. `npm run
 * typecheck` compiling this file under both configurations is the reading that says so.
 *
 * WHAT THE DECLARATION SAYS, and each field is a claim the invariant board holds the result to:
 *   · `tokens: { confidence: true, timestamps: true }` — the whole reason this recogniser is being
 *     added. A patched runtime fills the decoder's `token_log_probs` and its per-token timestamps,
 *     so the adapter returns a token list and the board checks every confidence is in `(0, 1]` and
 *     every `startMs` is finite and non-negative.
 *   · `locality: 'local-server'` — the audio stays on this host. A caller deciding whether a
 *     recording may leave the device reads this and nothing else.
 *   · no `credentials` — there is no key and no address. The settings form renders the credential
 *     block only for a provider that declares one, so this declaration is what makes the key field
 *     disappear rather than a branch in the form.
 *   · `meta.buildId` — a local engine's text is a property of the BUILD, not of a service, so a
 *     reading taken here has to name the artifacts that produced it. The manifest in
 *     `scripts/sensevoice/manifest.json` is the frozen record the build id is checked against.
