/**
 * The THIRD recogniser adapter: DashScope's `qwen3.8-omni-flash` — spoken instruction in, WRITTEN
 * instruction out, over a chat-completions wire that carries the audio inline.
 *
 * IT IS THE REPOSITORY'S ONLY `style: 'written'` RECOGNISER, and that is what the wire is for:
 * `docs/proposals/voice-dashscope-omni-written-instruction.md` §2 fixes the body below, and the E
 * group in `experiments/voice-omni-written/` is the measurement the body rests on. The other two
 * adapters ask their service for the words as they were spoken; this one hands the model a task —
 * transcribe, then rewrite into an instruction an agent can execute — and returns the rewrite.
 *
 * THE FROZEN PROMPT LIVES HERE, AND ITS SIX CONSTANTS ARE NOT THIS TASK'S SUBJECT. `ROLE`, `RULES`,
 * `EXAMPLES`, `JSON_TASK`, `REASONING_EFFORT` and `DEFAULT_MODEL` below are the E group's prompt,
 * character for character, frozen by the task that created this module and compared against the
 * experiment snapshot segment by segment by `scripts/asr-omni-prompt-frozen-check.mjs`. Editing one
 * character of one of them is a change to a measured artefact, and that checker names which segment
 * moved. What THIS module adds is the half the freeze deliberately left out — the wire, the parse
 * and its degradation — so the module's own comment used to say it carried no `transcribe`, no
 * `capabilities` and no `id`; that sentence was true of the frozen half and is now the thing this
 * header replaces.
 *
 * THE WIRE IS `'chat-audio'`, and it is a third shape rather than a variant of the other two: an
 * OpenAI-compatible chat body — `POST {baseUrl}/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions`, a bearer
 * credential, `application/json` — whose user turn carries the recording as an `input_audio` data
 * URI beside a text part. Neither existing wire can express it: `multipart` posts a form and reads
 * a transcription envelope, `inline-json` posts a generation request whose parts are `inlineData`
 * blocks. So the tag is DECLARED (`AsrWire`), and the contract board derives its expectations from
 * the declaration — a body that contradicts the tag it carries reds there rather than quietly
 * defining a shape nothing describes.
 *
 * THE PARSE DEGRADES RATHER THAN FAILING, which is a product decision with a measurement behind it:
 * the model's written rewrite is sometimes not a JSON object at all (the experiment's raw readings
 * are the evidence), and losing a usable transcription because the wrapper was missing would be
 * worse than returning the transcription. `transcribe` below therefore answers in four shapes, in
 * this order — the table is `docs/proposals/voice-dashscope-omni-written-instruction.md` §2:
 *
 *   · an `instruction` — the answer was a JSON object and the rewrite is non-empty ⇒ `style:
 *     'written'`, and the caller's text IS the instruction;
 *   · otherwise a `transcript` ⇒ `style: 'verbatim'`, `transformations: []` and
 *     `meta.writtenFallback: 1`, so the degradation is a READING the UI and the metrics can select
 *     rather than a silent downgrade;
 *   · neither of the two, in an answer that parsed ⇒ `NO_SPEECH_DETECTED`;
 *   · an answer that is not this service's envelope at all ⇒ `UPSTREAM_ERROR`.
 *
 * The wrapper is allowed — first `{` to last `}`, exactly as §2 says — and the CONTENT is never
 * handed back as the transcription on its way to a failure: the fourth row above is a statement
 * about the envelope (a gateway page, a truncated body), not about a model that answered in prose.
 * A model that answers in prose HAS answered, so its text is the transcript; that is the second row
 * read at its widest, and it is why the fallback is a passthrough for an answer with no JSON object
 * in it and an extraction for one with.
 *
 * EVERY DEPENDENCY ARRIVES THROUGH `AsrInvocation` — base URL, credential, model, timeout, the
 * transport and the abort signal — and the two guards run before the transport is touched: an
 * undeclared container is refused before anything is sized, and an oversized request is refused
 * before anything is encoded or sent. The budget is the WHOLE request (§2: the service's 10 MB
 * inline ceiling covers the prompt, the task turn and the encoded audio together), which is why
 * `measureChatRequestBytes` sizes the body it is about to send rather than the audio inside it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, because a reader will otherwise look for it: this
 * module owns the wire, the parse and the endpoint rule, and nothing above it — the settings tab,
 * the user-level provider selection, key masking and the health reading's `configured` semantics
 * belong to tasks of their own.
 *
 * THE ENDPOINT RULE IS DECLARED HERE AND ENFORCED ELSEWHERE, which is the point of `allowedBaseUrl`
 * below: what counts as this service's address is a fact this module knows and no other module
 * should hold a second copy of, while the refusal it produces is the server's to issue before a
 * request is built. The rule's own text is
 * `docs/proposals/voice-dashscope-omni-written-instruction.md` §3 verbatim, not a rule invented
 * here; the module comment says so because a later reader comparing the two must find them equal.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT NEUTRALITY, the same machine property `../../asrRegistry.ts` documents: this file is
 * compiled by BOTH compiler configurations (root: `lib: ES2020 + DOM`, `types: vite/client`;
 * server: `lib: ES2022`, NodeNext, `types: node`), so it uses no Node built-in and no ES2021+
 * library feature, and relative specifiers end in `.js`.

 *     about the transport.
 *   · THE HOSTNAME IS ONE OF THE TWO DECLARED SHAPES — a workspace under `maas`, or the service's
 *     public hostname. This is the SSRF clause: the address a user types travels to a cloud
 *     metadata endpoint or an internal service exactly as readily as to this one, so the hosts the
 *     value may name are enumerated rather than filtered. `aliyuncs.com.evil.com` and

 *   · NO PORT — the service is reached on its own default port. A port is a way to point a
 *     permitted hostname at something else entirely on the other end of it.
 *   · NO USER INFORMATION — `https://user:pass@host` sends a credential this path does not own and
 *     makes the authority a string no reader of the address would expect.
 *
 * A value that is not a URL at all is refused here too, and by the same answer: `new URL` throwing
 * is not a different meaning, it is the same "this is not this service's address". The caller reads
 * the boolean; the code and message it turns into are the server's (`INVALID_BASE_URL`).
