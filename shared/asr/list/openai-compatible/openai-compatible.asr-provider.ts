/**
 * The FIRST recogniser adapter: the shipped OpenAI-compatible transcription service, multipart.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS AT ALL. The shipped path has spoken to this service since before the seam
 * did — `shared/asr/transcriptionWire.ts` is its wire, and the browser's direct path, the server's
 * proxy path and the command line all go through it. What was missing was the ADDRESS: no adapter
 * was registered under this service's id, so nothing in the registry could answer for the
 * recogniser every recording actually reaches. The first symptom was the trim, which asks the
 * registry 裁不裁 and got no declaration at all (ADR-004 decision 1); the shape is general — a
 * provider the app uses but the address book does not list answers no question about itself.
 *
 * IT IS THE SHIPPED WIRE, NOT A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION OF IT. `transcribe` composes the two halves
 * of `../../transcriptionWire.js` (`createTranscriptionRequest`, `parseTranscriptionResponse`) and
 * nothing else: the request construction and the answer parsing stay in the one module that
 * already owned them, so registering this adapter cannot make the app send something different
 * from what it sent yesterday. The guards below (container, budget) run BEFORE the wire is
 * touched, which is the discipline the second adapter shares and the invariant board measures.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT NEUTRALITY, the same machine property `../../asrRegistry.ts` documents: this file is
 * compiled by BOTH compiler configurations (root: `lib: ES2020 + DOM`, `types: vite/client`;
 * server: `lib: ES2022`, NodeNext, `types: node`), so it uses no Node built-in and no ES2021+
 * library feature, and every environment dependency (base URL, credential, model, transport,
 * signal) arrives through `AsrInvocation`.

 * This provider's capability declaration, every field read off what the shipped path does today.

 *   · `acceptsMime` is the set of containers the seam already serves: the recorder's own
 *     `audio/webm;codecs=opus` (matched on the base type) and the files the pickers offer. A
 *     shorter list would refuse an upload the app accepts today; a longer one would admit a
 *     container the shipped path has never been handed.
 *   · `maxInlineRequestBytes` is this service's own published ceiling for one request, and it is
 *     the figure the transport layer was reading before the budget became a declaration (ADR-004
 *     §缺口②: the 25 MB global bound). It is a REQUEST maximum: the whole upload, not a share of it.
 *   · `honors` IS ALL FALSE, and that is a reading of the wire rather than a view about the
 *     service: `createTranscriptionRequest` puts the file and the model on the request and nothing
 *     else, so a hint this module declared it honored would be a hint no code knows how to send —
 *     and ADR-004 §二's paired measurement is the reason not to add one (a prompt collapses Chinese
 *     punctuation on the trimmed path, and the product carries no language to switch on).
 *   · `billing: 'audio-seconds'` and `style: 'verbatim'`: a saved second is a saved second here
 *     (this service bills by audio, with a per-request floor), and the answer comes back as spoken.
 *   · `pauseCues: 'destructive'` — the shipped default the trim was taken under: trimming hits this
 *     recogniser's Chinese punctuation (−89%, `docs/experiments/2026-09-22-voice-punctuation.md`),
 *     so its silence is removed before the audio is uploaded.

 * Neither produces an upstream call. The wire itself is built by `transcriptionWire.ts`.
 *
 * THE READING OF THE ANSWER IS THE CALLER'S, not this module's, and that is why it arrives on the
 * invocation. This wire has two callers with two historical readings of the same bytes — the
 * browser's direct path takes a body that is not this service's JSON as a failed transcription,
 * the server's proxy path has always handed it back verbatim as the transcript — and
 * `TranscriptionTolerance` is that difference written down once (`../../transcriptionWire.ts`).
 * The default is `strict`, so a caller that says nothing about tolerance (the direct path, the
 * invariant probes) keeps the reading it had before; the proxy path names `lenient` at its call
 * site instead of this module guessing from who is asking.
 *
 * The empty answer is read by the same tolerance, and it is the second half of that difference
 * rather than a separate rule: `lenient` means "whatever came back is the transcript", and an
 * empty transcript is a successful transcription of silence — the proxy path has always answered
 * `ok` with an empty string there. `strict` keeps calling it `NO_SPEECH_DETECTED`, because the
 * direct path's caller needs the distinction to tell "you said nothing" from "the service failed".
