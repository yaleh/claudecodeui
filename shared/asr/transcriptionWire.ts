/**
 * The transcription wire protocol, in exactly one place.
 *
 * Three consumers reach this file and no consumer re-derives any of it:
 *
 *   · the browser's direct path (`src/shared/api.ts` builds the request, the chat hook
 *     reads the answer back),
 *   · the server's proxy path (`server/modules/voice/voice.service.ts`),
 *   · the command line (`experiments/voice-asr-cli/transcribe.ts`).
 *
 * Before this module existed the request construction and the response parsing were each
 * written twice, once per path, and the two copies had already drifted: the same upstream
 * answer that the direct path reports as an error is accepted as a transcript by the proxy
 * path. The divergence is not incidental, it is what two copies do — so the tolerance is
 * now an explicit argument (`TranscriptionTolerance`) that each path names at its call
 * site, rather than a property of whichever file you happen to be reading.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT NEUTRALITY IS A MACHINE PROPERTY HERE, not a style choice. This file is
 * compiled by BOTH compiler configurations — the root one (lib ES2020 + DOM, types
 * `vite/client`, moduleResolution Bundler) and `server/tsconfig.json` (lib ES2022,
 * NodeNext, types `node`) — so it may use neither Node built-ins nor ES2021+ library
 * features, and every environment dependency (fetch, credentials, base URL) stays injected
 * at the call site. `npm run typecheck` compiling this one file under both configurations
 * is the reading that says so.
