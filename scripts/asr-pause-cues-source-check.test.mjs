/**
 * The falsification controls for scripts/asr-pause-cues-source-check.mjs.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CASE IS FOR. The probe's judgement is a comparison: the value the client would act on
 * against the value the registry declares for the effective provider. A probe like that can be
 * wrong in two opposite ways, and a control is needed for each:
 *
 *   · it reds on trees it should not — the control is a rig whose client declaration EQUALS the
 *     registry's, which has to stay green. A probe that reds on any client-side table would pass
 *     every "it must be red" case below while being useless.
 *   · it stays green on trees it should red — the control is the same rig with that one value
 *     changed to the registry's opposite, which has to red and to say which two values disagreed.
 *
 * Both cases drive the SAME rig, and both assert green on it BEFORE the mutation. That ordering is
 * the whole of the evidence: it rules out a red that came from the fixture being broken rather
 * than from the mutation, and it makes the two cases differ by exactly one string.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE IS COPIED FROM THE SHIPPING FILES, never re-typed, and it is the probe's own
 * `FIXTURE_FILES` list that says which ones. A hand-written stub would prove the probe reads the
 * stub; a fixture checked into the repository would be a second copy of the very declaration this
 * criterion is about.
 *
 * Run with: node --test scripts/asr-pause-cues-source-check.test.mjs
