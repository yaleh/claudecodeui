/**
 * The controls for `scripts/e2e-data-dir-selection.mjs` — the module `playwright.config.ts` asks where
 * its data directory goes.
 *
 * WHY THESE CASES EXIST. The defect this module fixes was invisible: a run that did not fit on the
 * root filesystem failed *inside* a case as `ENOSPC` / `net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`, which reads
 * as the case's subject being broken. Each case below is therefore aimed at one half of what has to
 * hold for the failure to be legible instead:
 *
 *   AC3(a) a candidate with room is chosen          — and the choice's own three numbers are printed
 *   AC3(b) no candidate with room ⇒ a refusal       — never a fallback to the same full filesystem
 *   AC3    an unreadable candidate is skipped       — and is not silently read as "zero bytes free"
 *   AC3    the floor is the environment's, not a constant — raised, it refuses a candidate that fits
 *   AC3    the floor is never silently defaulted    — a floor that cannot be read is itself a refusal
 *   AC3(b) the refusal really ends the process      — read as a child's exit code, not as a call log
 *   AC3    `QUAY_E2E_DATA_DIR` is honoured verbatim — a worker must not re-decide a run already under way
 *
 * THE READINGS, NOT THE PROMISES. Nothing here asserts that a message "says" a refusal happened. The
 * process-level case runs the real default failure path in a child process and reads its exit status
 * and its two streams; the printing case reads the tokens a run leaves for an outside `df`; and the
 * "skipped" cases assert that the short candidate was *consulted* and recorded, so "skipped" cannot
 * be satisfied by a module that never looked at it ([[anti-fake-variant-passes-means-criterion-hole]]
 * in the inverse: a green case has to be unreachable without the behaviour).
 *
 * THE FILESYSTEM READING IS INJECTED in every case but the last, so that "no candidate has room" is
 * an input rather than an environment: the criterion this backs (AC3) has to be falsifiable without
 * root and without standing up a small filesystem, and that property belongs to the tests too.
