/**
 * The controls for `scripts/asr-extraction-parity-check.mjs` (AC-130's criterion).
 *
 * A criterion that reads four byte-identical groups off the shipped code is only worth what its
 * controls are worth, so each of the four fake shapes the task names gets a case of its own:
 *
 *   AC2  a baseline that is not pre-extraction   — the recorded commit no longer carries the inline
 *                                                  inbound field write, or is not an ancestor of
 *                                                  HEAD, or is unreadable
 *   AC3  the inbound form field renamed          — `audio` -> `file`, in the shipping source
 *   AC4  the seam made as tolerant as the proxy  — `parseTranscriptionResponse` returns the raw
 *                                                  body instead of throwing
 *   AC5  a reader that is missing, or that
 *        prints nothing and exits 0
 *
 * Every mutation case is a PAIR of assertions, in this order: the same command must exit 0 on the
 * same tree before the mutation, and must exit non-zero after it. The first half is what makes the
 * second half mean anything — without it, "it went red" could just as well be "this tree never ran
 * at all", which is a fake shape this repository has already paid for once. Each case also asserts
 * the mutation hit exactly one site: a substitution that matched nothing would otherwise leave the
 * tree green while the case reported "red after mutation".
 *
 * The mutations are applied to a temporary git worktree, never to this checkout, and the probe is
 * pointed at it with `--root` — the flag exists so that a control can drive a tree that is not the
 * one it lives in.
