/**
 * The falsification controls for scripts/asr-mime-size-gaps-check.mjs (AC9).
 *
 * Four ways the container whitelist and the two-layer size limit could have been faked, one at a
 * time. Each case first runs the probe against an UNMUTATED fixture and requires green, then
 * applies exactly one mutation and requires the probe to go red on the reading that mutation
 * breaks. Both halves matter: only the second proves the probe notices the fake, and only the
 * first proves the red came from the mutation rather than from a probe that is red for everything.
 *
 * The four, and the reading each one must move:
 *   1. the whitelist refuses everything                                   -> declared-container-bare
 *   2. the container is matched as an exact string                        -> declared-container-parameterised
 *   3. only the proxy face gates, the browser sends whatever it has       -> two-paths-same-code
 *   4. the budget is written down as a figure of the gate's own           -> provider-switch-budget
 *
 * The fourth is the one the AC singles out: the reading that has to move is the ADAPTER's refusal,
 * not the transport ceiling's. Hardcoding the gate's figure moves no request through multer at all,
 * which is why the control reads the gate directly and not a status code.
 *
 * The fixture is built at run time, in a temporary directory, OUT OF THE SHIPPING FILES — copied,
 * never re-typed (see `buildFixture` in the probe).
 *
 * Run with: node --test scripts/asr-mime-size-gaps-check.test.mjs
