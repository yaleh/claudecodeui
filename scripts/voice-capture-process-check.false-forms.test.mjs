/**
 * The controls for `scripts/voice-capture-process-check.mjs` (AC-148's criterion; AC5 of
 * `gap-voice-capture-real-process`).
 *
 * The criterion reports that a REAL server process, started from a real `server/index.ts` under a
 * real `VOICE_CAPTURE`, writes a start-up line and a capture row to its stdout. A criterion that
 * says so and nothing more is worth exactly as much as the fakes it can tell apart from that
 * outcome — and the fake this one exists to catch is named in the task's DoD: "the capture only
 * holds inside a unit test's injected port and was never wired into the real service's assembly".
 * A tree in which the seam is never handed to `createVoiceService` boots perfectly and transcribes
 * perfectly; only the capture-row reading notices.
 *
 * So each case here is a PAIR, in this order:
 *
 *   1. the criterion runs against an unmutated throwaway tree and must exit 0;
 *   2. the SAME tree, with ONE textual change in `server/modules/voice/voice.module.ts`, runs again
 *      and must exit 1 — with the change of exactly one named reading, and with the other case's
 *      reading still green.
 *
 * The first half is what makes the second mean anything: without it, "it went red" could just as
 * well be "this tree never ran". The second half is read off the criterion's own printed readings
 * and its own `check.failure:` lines, not off the exit code alone, which is why each case asserts
 * three things about the mutant: its status is 1 (not 2, which the criterion reserves for "the
 * measurement could not be made"), the named reading is wrong, and the reading the OTHER case
 * reds is still right. Two mutations that both took the whole criterion down would satisfy
 * "red" and fail this.
 *
 * WHAT THE TWO MUTATIONS ARE, AND WHY THEY ARE SHAPED THIS WAY.
 *
 *   `assembly-not-wired` deletes the one place that hands the capture port to the service —
 *   `capture: createVoiceCapture({ ... }),`, whose argument object the audio tier later grew (AC-145
 *   added the `audio` sink), so the anchor below is the whole multi-line property. The port is
 *   optional, so the service still transcribes and the start-up line is still printed; only
 *   `capture.lines` moves, 1 → 0.
 *
 *   `startup-line-missing` deletes the one call that announces the mode. It is NOT a bare
 *   deletion: `voiceCapture` is read again eight lines later, so removing the statement outright
 *   makes the module throw at load, the child never prints `CloudCLI Server - Ready`, and the
 *   criterion exits 2 with no readings at all — a red that names nothing, which is the failure
 *   shape this AC is written against. The mutation therefore deletes the announcing call and
 *   inlines the single field the rest of the file reads, which is the smallest single-site change
 *   that removes the announcement and nothing else. `startup.text.count` moves, 1 → 0; the capture
 *   row is still recorded.
 *
 * WHERE THE MUTATIONS ARE APPLIED. Never to this checkout. Each case builds its own tree by
 * HARD-LINKING the repo (`cp -al`, the mechanism AC5 names — the criterion boots a real server out
 * of it, and 1 700 hard links cost milliseconds where a byte copy costs a second), points the
 * criterion at it with `--root`, and removes it when the case ends. The one file a case mutates is
 * REPLACED rather than written in place: under `cp -al` that path shares its inode with the
 * checkout's file, so an in-place write would edit the checkout through the link. `mutate` asserts
 * the checkout's copy is byte-identical after the substitution, which is the reading that says the
 * hard link was not written through.
 *
 * `.git` IS REMOVED FROM THE COPY, and that is a safety measure rather than tidiness. In a worktree
 * `.git` is not a directory but an 88-byte pointer file holding the absolute path of the real git
 * directory; hard-linked into the copy it is a live wire into this checkout's git state, so any git
 * command run from the copy would write into the real worktree's administrative files. In the
 * PRIMARY checkout `.git` is a plain directory, so the removal must say `recursive: true`: a
 * `force`-only `rmSync` on a directory throws `ERR_FS_EISDIR`, which is exactly how this control was
 * red in the primary checkout (and it then leaked the copy). The criterion needs no git — it boots a
 * server, mints a token and makes one HTTP request — so the wire is cut, in either shape.
 *
 * ONE READING IS TAKEN OUT OF THE PICTURE. `DATABASE_PATH` is deleted from the criterion's
 * environment for the two MUTATION cases above, so its `real-db-untouched` reading is trivially
 * true and the mutant's red is attributable to the named reading and nothing else. That reading is
 * about a file this control does not own — the deployer's live database, which this repository's own
 * running server writes to — and a case that reds because the operator's traffic happened to land
 * inside its window would be reporting on the host rather than on its mutation. The criterion
 * measures it, under the real inherited value, on its own runs.
 *
 * THE ATTRIBUTION CASES OWN A DATABASE ON PURPOSE. The two cases below (`real-db attribution` and
 * its negative control) point `DATABASE_PATH` at a database THIS control creates and HOLDS OPEN for
 * the whole run — the deployer's server, reproduced as a foreign holder that is not in the
 * criterion's process tree. That is the whole discriminator: the reading must be false only when
 * the criterion's OWN tree holds the file, so a foreign holder that writes once and then goes quiet
 * (the shape that used to red the criterion) has to stay green, and a child that inherits the
 * criterion's own `DATABASE_PATH` has to red with evidence naming the handle, not the clock.
 *
 * THE CHECKOUT IS READ BEFORE AND AFTER. AC5 asks that the worktree's `git status --porcelain` be
 * empty once the copies are gone. Every case asserts the invariant that makes that meaningful — no
 * TRACKED file in the checkout was modified, and no entry anywhere in the status names a file this
 * control can reach — and the full status is printed before and after so a reader can see it.
 *
 * The tracked half is the assertion rather than literal emptiness because the rest of this suite
 * writes into the tree while the tests run: measured here, a sibling script test creates and removes
 * `scripts/.probe-mutant-<random>/` about 55 s into a `npm run test:scripts` run. The copy is the
 * only thing this control can write to, and a write through a hard link lands on a TRACKED file —
 * so tracked-modification is exactly the harm, and a control that reds on another test's scratch
 * directory would be measuring the suite rather than itself.
