/**
 * AC-138 — the dashscope-omni adapter, checked by RUNNING it rather than by reading it.
 *
 * WHY THIS PROBE EXECUTES THE TREE INSTEAD OF SCANNING IT. The claim under test is "this adapter,
 * offline and against a stand-in upstream, says the right thing": which request it builds, what it
 * makes of each answer shape, how it maps a transport failure, and whether an unaffordable request
 * ever leaves. None of those is visible in a source file. So the probe loads the SHIPPING module —
 * found by the id it declares, not by a path this file asserts — and drives its `transcribe` with an
 * injected transport whose recorded request and call count are the readings.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT GO THROUGH THE REGISTRY, and that is the task's boundary rather than a shortcut: this
 * adapter is not registered (registering it and dispatching to it from `voice.service.ts` is a later
 * task), so the registry cannot hand it out. The board's three probes are fed the module's own
 * `adapter` export for the same reason.
 *
 * THE SIX READINGS THAT CARRY THE TASK, one mechanical measurement each:
 *
 *   · the request is this wire's shape — the endpoint, the two headers, the decode parameters, the
 *     system turn, and a user turn whose parts are one `input_audio` and one `text` (AC2);
 *   · the prompt on the wire is the shipping module's own three segments joined, with each segment
 *     present and each hash the recorded one (AC3) — the tooling holds no prompt text, only hashes;
 *   · the answer is read as the service's chat envelope and DEGRADES rather than failing: a rewrite
 *     when there is one, the transcription when the wrapper was missing, `NO_SPEECH_DETECTED` when
 *     the service heard nothing, and `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` when the body was not an answer at all —
 *     raw response is never handed back as the text (AC5–AC7);
 *   · a 401/403/429/timeout/transport failure each reach their own code, and the two 403s — a model
 *     this account has not enabled versus a plain refusal — carry two DIFFERENT messages (AC8);
 *   · an unaffordable request is refused with ZERO requests at the stand-in, and an affordable one
 *     is sent — the second half is what makes the guard a line rather than a wall (AC9);
 *   · the caller's hints are nowhere on the body while the audio and the task turn ARE, so a builder
 *     that put nothing on the wire could not pass by sending nothing (AC10).
 *
 * OFFLINE IS ENFORCED, NOT ASSERTED (AC12). Every drive injects its own transport, and the probe
 * also REPLACES `globalThis.fetch` with a poison for the duration: an adapter that reaches for the
 * ambient fetch instead of the injected one is caught by the poison, counted and reported, rather
 * than merely discouraged.
 *
 * AN EMPTY READING IS A FAILURE (AC1). A tree that does not hold the seam — an empty `--root` — is
 * reported as `EMPTY_READING` for every case that should have run, and the probe exits non-zero:
 * "nothing was measured" must never be indistinguishable from "everything held".
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROBE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, stated here because its output is otherwise easy to
 * over-read: it is not a measurement of the live service (ADR-004 decision 8 keeps the real smoke
 * test manual, out of CI), the model it names is an alias the service may re-point, and the prompt
 * TEXT is not in this tooling — the hashes are, and `scripts/asr-omni-prompt-frozen-check.mjs` is
 * the reading that pins the text itself to the experiment snapshot.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/asr-dashscope-omni-check.mjs [--root <dir>]
 *
 *   --root <dir>   the tree to check (default: this script's repository root). The falsification
 *                  controls point it at a throwaway tree assembled from the shipping files, which is
 *                  what makes each fake form an executable case rather than a paragraph.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = every reading above held; 1 = at least one reading disagreed, or a case produced
 * no reading at all. Every failing reading prints its own `FAIL <TOKEN> <id> value=… expected=…`
 * line, so a red run still shows what was measured.
