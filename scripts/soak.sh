#!/usr/bin/env bash
# soak.sh — the manual entry point of the server soak harness (gap-server-soak-harness).
#
#   bash scripts/soak.sh --duration <seconds> [--report <file>] [--keep] [--burst-mb <n>]
#   bash scripts/soak.sh --duration <seconds> --burst-mb <n> --slow-client-drains
#   bash scripts/soak.sh --self-test
#
# THE SLOW-CLIENT HYPOTHESIS IS ANSWERED BY A PAIR OF RUNS, not by one. `--slow-client-drains` runs
# the control arm of the slow-client leg (soak-driver.mjs): the same socket, handshake, subscribe and
# window, but the bytes ARE read. A single arm cannot separate "the server retained the unread
# frames" from "the workload simply grew", so the conclusion is read from the DIFFERENCE between
#   bash scripts/soak.sh --duration 120 --burst-mb 500 --report hyp.json
#   bash scripts/soak.sh --duration 120 --burst-mb 500 --slow-client-drains --report ctl.json
# The control arm's `slowClientDrainedBytes` is the positive control that the server really pushed
# the burst (a stalled socket the server never wrote to proves nothing); the hypothesis arm's RSS
# trajectory is the reading. `--burst-mb` must exceed what the kernel socket buffers can absorb
# (~4MiB send + a few MiB receive on loopback, see net.ipv4.tcp_wmem), otherwise the burst never
# reaches the server's user-space send queue and the leg tests nothing — and it should exceed the
# workload's own churn, or the two arms are indistinguishable above noise. The mock gateway streams
# its reply frame by frame under backpressure, so the gateway's own memory does NOT scale with
# `--burst-mb`; it can be raised to the hundreds of MiB the differential needs — but not past 500:
# the reply is ONE assistant message, the `claude` CLI writes it as ONE `stream-json` line, and
# `--burst-mb 512` is 536,870,912 characters against V8's `2**29 - 24` maximum string length, so the
# server's `readline` dies with `RangeError: Invalid string length` at t~42s in BOTH arms. The
# largest drivable burst is bracketed to (500MiB, 512MiB]; past that the ceiling is the CLI's
# protocol hop, not this harness (see docs/operations/process-isolation-and-memory-caps.md).
#
# MANUAL BY CONSTRUCTION. Nothing in this repo calls this script: not scripts/test.sh, not
# `npm test`, not a quay routine. package.json exposes it as `npm run soak`, and the task's own AC
# greps to keep it that way. That is deliberate — a soak starts a REAL server and runs for minutes,
# which is something an operator asks for, never something a fan-in does on every change.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, in order (see scripts/soak-driver.mjs for the agitator and sampler themselves):
#
#   1. A private working directory: temp HOME, temp DATABASE_PATH, temp transcript directory, temp
#      diagnostics directory. The real ~/.claude and the real auth.db are never read or written —
#      HOME is redirected for the server, and the Claude CLI derives its config dir from HOME.
#   2. A mock Anthropic endpoint on 127.0.0.1 (scripts/soak-driver.mjs mock-gateway), so the REAL
#      `claude` binary can be driven end-to-end with no credentials and no network egress. This is
#      the task's preferred session source: readings from the real binary beat readings from a fake.
#   3. The real server (node --import tsx server/index.ts) in its OWN transient systemd unit, on a
#      free port that is explicitly not 3001. The :3001 server (`claudecodeui-server.service`) and
#      its cgroup are not touched at any point.
#   4. A 30-minute-capped observation token (scripts/mint-token.mjs) against the temp DB. The driver
#      adopts the server's `X-Refreshed-Token` re-issue, so a run longer than the token's TTL stays
#      authenticated (see the header of soak-driver.mjs).
#   5. The driver: agitate + sample every 5s + judge. Its verdict is this script's exit code.
#
# CLEANUP IS NOT OPTIONAL. Every path out of this script — green, red, harness error, Ctrl-C — runs
# the same trap: session scopes owned by OUR server pid are stopped, the soak unit is stopped and
# reset, the mock gateway is killed. The scopes are matched by the owner pid embedded in their unit
# name (`claudecodeui-session-<ownerPid>-<suffix>`, claude-session-scope.service.ts), so a scope
# belonging to the operator's own :3001 session is never a candidate.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = green, 1 = red, 2 = the harness could not run.

                   the kernel socket buffers — and above the run's own churn — when the send-buffer
                   hypothesis is the question; the gateway streams, so its memory is not a ceiling.
  --slow-client-drains
                   run the slow-client leg's CONTROL arm: identical socket, handshake, subscribe and
                   window, but the bytes are read. Pair it with a matching --burst-mb run to answer
                   the send-buffer hypothesis differentially (the header explains the two arms).
  --self-test      run the harness's own positive control: a leaking stub must be judged red
                   (naming RSS) and a steady stub green. No server is started.
