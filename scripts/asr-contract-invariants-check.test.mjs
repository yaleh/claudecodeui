/**
 * The control test for the transcription seam's invariant board.
 *
 * A board that passes on a healthy tree says almost nothing on its own — an inert implementation,
 * a board whose probes never ran, and a board whose comparisons never fire all pass on a healthy
 * tree. So this file drives the checker against MUTATED COPIES of the tree and requires the board
 * to red, in the specific group it broke and nowhere else.
 *
 * ONE MUTATION PER GROUP, which is the property that makes the five groups five groups: a board
 * that reds everywhere on any change is not measuring anything, so every case below also asserts
 * that the four untouched groups still PASS.
 *
 *   · `request-construction` — the AC1 variant, in both of its halves: the adapter forwards the
 *     prompt it declared it would not forward, AND it forwards an empty prompt as an empty part.
 *     The declared-unhonored case alone would not catch the second: "not sent" and "sent empty"
 *     reach the service as the same nothing.
 *   · `error-mapping` — every failure collapses onto one code, the classifier made a constant. The
 *     rows that already expect that code must STAY GREEN, which is what shows the group distinguishes
 *     codes rather than reacting to any failure at all. Those rows are the whole
 *     `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` group — the 5xx, the 4xx that is not a credential refusal, the aborted
 *     request, the transport that never answered and the body that is not JSON — because that member
 *     of `AsrErrorCode` is where the transport failures were merged.
 *   · `size-layering` — the budget guard is removed, so a request past the declared maximum is
 *     sent instead of refused.
 *   · `redaction` — the adapter names the credential inside its own failure message, on its way
 *     out to the caller.
 *   · `mime-gate` — the container gate is removed, so an undeclared container is uploaded.
 *   · an empty registry — the reading that keeps a green board from meaning nothing: zero
 *     providers must exit non-zero with every group unmeasured, never print "the invariants hold".
 *
 * Each mutation is a copy of `shared/` in a throwaway directory plus one or more literal
 * replacements. Every replacement is asserted to match exactly once before it is applied: a
 * mutation that quietly did not apply would leave this file asserting nothing, which is the same
 * failure it exists to catch.
 *
 * THE CHECKER IS DRIVEN WITH BARE `node`, which is the command the criterion names. It measures
 * TypeScript, so it re-executes itself under tsx — resolved from the checker's own file, so neither
 * this test nor a driven tree needs a `node_modules` of its own. Spawning it the way the criterion
 * does is what makes this file a witness for that command rather than for a loader someone has to
 * remember to pass.
