#!/usr/bin/env bash
# start-drivers-scoped.sh [start-drivers.js args...] — start the quay drivers (promotion + worker)
# and the web server inside the memory-capped fleet slice.
#
# Why: the 2026-09-25 host OOM happened in a scope that a session had started ad hoc with no
# `MemoryMax`, so the drivers and every worker they spawn (claude sessions running vitest, tsx, tsc)
# could take all 252G of a host shared with other users. This puts them under one ceiling:
# ~/.config/systemd/user/quay-fleet.slice (MemoryHigh=48G throttles first, MemoryMax=64G kills).
#
# `QUAY_MEMORY_SLICE` is exported so scripts/with-memory-cap.sh puts each per-test scope under the
# SAME slice: `systemd-run --scope` does not nest under the caller's cgroup, so without it those
# scopes would sit outside the ceiling. `OOMPolicy=continue` keeps one OOM-killed worker from
# stopping the whole scope (systemd's default for a scope would be to stop it).
#
# `QUAY_TEST_SYSTEMD_RUN_LIMITS` is the second half of the same idea, for the full-suite runner. That
# runner wraps the whole suite in its OWN `systemd-run --scope`, whose cap comes from the plugin's
# `DEFAULT_SYSTEMD_RUN_LIMITS` = 6G unless overridden. That scope is created by the runner, so it
# lands in `app.slice` and NOT in the fleet slice above — the fleet ceiling does not back it, and its
# own 6G is the only thing bounding it. 6G is below what the suite needs: the server phase runs 163
# per-file `node --test` processes, 16 at a time, several of which spawn a real `claude` CLI
# (~300-430MB each measured) — so the scope is OOM-killed ~33s in and the suite reports
# "terminated by an external signal before the suite finished". The driver cannot attribute that to
# any file, so EVERY fan-in parks its task at needs-human and no task can ever land. 24G is the value
# scripts/with-memory-cap.sh already budgets for this same suite (QUAY_MEMORY_MAX), so the two
# wrappers around one suite now agree instead of disagreeing by 4x.
#
# Env:
#   QUAY_MEMORY_SLICE              slice to run under (default quay-fleet.slice)
#   QUAY_TEST_SYSTEMD_RUN_LIMITS   cap the full-suite runner puts on its own scope
#                                  (default MemoryMax=24G; the plugin's own default is 6G)
#   QUAY_PLUGIN_DIR                quay plugin dir holding scripts/dist/start-drivers.js
#                                  (default: newest release under ~/.claude/plugins/cache/quay/quay/)
