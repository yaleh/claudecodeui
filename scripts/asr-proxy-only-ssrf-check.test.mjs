/**
 * The falsification controls for scripts/asr-proxy-only-ssrf-check.mjs (AC-140).
 *
 * Each case below first runs the probe against an UNMUTATED fixture and requires green, then applies
 * exactly one mutation and requires red. Both halves matter: only the second proves the probe
 * notices the fake form, and only the first proves the red came from the mutation rather than from a
 * probe that is red for every input.
 *
 * The fixture is built at run time, in a temporary directory, OUT OF THE SHIPPING FILES — copied,
 * never re-typed, and symlinked to this repository's `node_modules` so the browser tree's bare
 * imports (`clsx`, `tailwind-merge`) resolve exactly as they do in the repository. A hand-written
 * stub would only prove the probe reads the stub; a copy of the real modules is what makes these
 * cases evidence about this repository rather than about a paragraph describing it.
 *
 * The mutations are the fake forms the criteria name, one apiece:
 *
 *   · AC4 — `direct-despite-proxy-only`: the client's route condition goes inert, so a recording
 *     for a provider a browser cannot address is sent to the stored address anyway. The "zero
 *     requests to that address" half is the thing that has to notice.
 *   · AC7 — `host-check-removed`: the server's pre-request step stops asking the rule, so an
 *     address the provider may not be reached at is left to the format gate — which answers 400
 *     without the code the criterion reads.
 *   · AC7 — `rule-loosened`: the shipping rule itself is made always-true for a well-formed https
 *     address, so the same eight near-miss inputs are all admitted.
 *   · AC7 — `whitelist-for-every-provider`: the rule is consulted for a provider that declares
 *     `'direct'`, so the door the address is supposed to be for every other provider becomes a wall
 *     for them too — caught by AC8's passthrough control, not by AC6's.
 *
 * WHY THE HOSTS ARE NOT WRITTEN HERE (AC9). This file and the probe it drives are both forbidden
 * from spelling the two service addresses: a probe that typed them would be a second place they
 * live. So the address readings below are taken from the probe's own OUTPUT, and the "neither file
 * spells it" half is checked against those reported values. Read together, they are the positive
 * control AC9 asks for: the addresses reach the run as inputs while appearing in neither file.
 *
 * The last two cases are the other half of the same discipline: AC9's run is also the one that
 * shows the addresses arriving, and AC10's run shows the criterion re-taking the seven contract
 * readings of the tree under test — against this repository, since a fixture carries no `scripts/`
 * for them to be taken from.
 *
 * Run with: node --test scripts/asr-proxy-only-ssrf-check.test.mjs
