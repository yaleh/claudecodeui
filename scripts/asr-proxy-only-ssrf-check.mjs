/**
 * AC-140 — where a recording may be addressed, checked by RUNNING the tree rather than by reading it.
 *
 * WHY THIS PROBE EXECUTES THE TREE INSTEAD OF SCANNING IT. The three claims this task ships are not
 * statements about wiring — they are statements about WHO is asked, WHAT is sent, and WHETHER
 * anything left. None of those is visible in a source file:
 *
 *   · the transport declaration and the demand that a proxy-only provider carries an endpoint rule
 *     (AC2) — read out of the fixture's own REGISTRY, so the answer is what the seam hands out
 *     rather than what one module says about itself;
 *   · the client route (AC3) — the SHIPPING `transcribeVoice` is driven with a stand-in transport,
 *     and the readings are the stand-in's own call list: zero requests to a stored workspace
 *     address, exactly one to the proxy, carrying the audio, under the provider's own routing
 *     header. The positive controls are on the same transport, so "zero" is a count of something
 *     that demonstrably happens elsewhere;
 *   · the server gate (AC5/AC6/AC8) — the SHIPPING `createVoiceService` is driven with an INJECTED
 *     counting `fetchBackend`, and a refused address must cost zero upstream calls. That half of
 *     the reading is a counter, not an inference from the error code.
 *
 * THE PROBE HOLDS NO HOST LIST OF ITS OWN (AC9), and that is the harder half of its design. The
 * criterion forbids this file and its control file from containing the two service hosts as text —
 * a probe that typed them would be a second place they live, which is exactly what the task exists
 * to remove. So the probe MINES its host examples out of the two records that already carry them
 * (the instruction proposal and the 2026-09-23 webm candidate record), and then lets the SHIPPING
 * RULE decide which of the mined tokens are addresses of this service and which are not. The rule
 * is therefore the instrument, not the subject: the probe asks it, and a rule that loosens (AC7's
 * `rule-loosened`) changes the answers the probe then reports. Every near-miss input — the
 * http-schemed form, the ported form, the credentialed form, the suffix form — is DERIVED from a
 * mined host at run time, so no forbidden literal is written here either.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROBE DOES NOT CLAIM (AC13). It measures two things and nothing else: a `'proxy-only'`
 * provider's direct path is zeroed, and the address a `'proxy-only'` provider may be reached at is
 * held to the rule its own module exports. It does NOT measure whether a user-stored service
 * address reaches the server, nor key masking, nor the `configured` flag (AC-141), and it does not
 * drive a browser (AC-142). The address under test is injected at `createVoiceService`'s
 * `defaults.baseUrl` seam, and every transport here is a stand-in or an injected function: nothing
 * in this file touches the real service (ADR-004 decision 8).
 *
 * AN EMPTY READING IS A FAILURE (AC1). A reading that cannot be taken — no registry, no rule, no
 * mineable host — prints `EMPTY_READING` and exits non-zero. "No problems were found" must never be
 * indistinguishable from "nothing was looked at", which is also why an empty `--root` is a failing
 * case rather than a vacuous pass.
 *
 * IT ALSO RE-TAKES THE SEVEN EXISTING CONTRACT READINGS (AC10), and those are the only processes
 * this file starts. AC10 asks the criterion for their exit codes, and an exit code cannot be read
 * out of a file, so the seven are executed and their codes printed. One of the seven is red on a
 * pristine `develop` for a reason this task does not touch (the closed wire vocabulary — see the
 * block at the reading), so a nonzero code is REPORTED and named rather than verdict-failed; what
 * is a verdict is that all seven ran. The fixtures that need a copy of the tree stay in
 * `scripts/asr-proxy-only-ssrf-check.test.mjs`, so the criterion's own budget (AC12) does not grow
 * with the number of mutation cases.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/asr-proxy-only-ssrf-check.mjs [--root <dir>]
 *
 *   --root <dir>   the tree to check (default: this script's repository root). The falsification
 *                  controls point it at a throwaway tree assembled from the shipping files, which
 *                  is what makes each fake form in the sibling test an executable case.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = every reading held; 1 = at least one verdict failed (each failing verdict prints
 * its own `FAIL <TOKEN>` line, carrying the value it was reading, before the readings).

  // ── AC10: the seven contract readings, re-taken here rather than assumed ──
  //
  // A NONZERO SIBLING IS REPORTED, NOT VERDICTED ON, and that is a fact about the tree rather than
  // a convenience. One of the seven is red on a pristine `develop`: that probe's wire vocabulary is
  // a closed set that folds the third wire into `inline-json`, so a correct `chat-audio` adapter is
  // read as the wrong wire and returns CREDENTIAL_NOT_ON_WIRE / ENVELOPE_NOT_READ — measured, by
  // running the same two files against a `git archive develop` tree and getting the same FAIL
  // tokens. Teaching it the third wire is `gap-asr-capability-probe-third-wire`<!-- dedup-ref:inline -->'s
  // work, and this task adds no wire, no request shape and no reading to those probes. So this
  // criterion has to stay green on a tree whose only reds are develop's — and the thing it DOES
  // assert is that all seven ran: a reading that was skipped must not look like one that passed.
  //
  // AC12's budget is read on the whole run, so the seven are started together; the fixtures that
  // need a copy of the tree, and the minutes they would add, are in the sibling test file.
  //
  // THE READINGS ARE TAKEN FROM THE TREE UNDER TEST — `--root`'s own `scripts/` — which is why a
  // falsification fixture, assembled from half a dozen shipping files and no scripts directory,
  // reports them as not started instead of running this repository's copies against a tree they
  // were not written for. A tree that carries the seven runs them; the criterion's default root is
  // this repository, so its own invocation is the one that takes all seven.
