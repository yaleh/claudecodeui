/**
 * Static guard for the fork release pipeline (yaleh/claudecodeui).
 *
 * The fork releases diverges from upstream (siteboon) in exactly these shape decisions, and each
 * one is a decision that silently REVERTS the moment someone re-syncs a file from upstream:
 *
 *   1. `package.json` names the fork `@yalehwang/cloudcli` and publishes it publicly. The
 *      upstream `@cloudcli-ai/cloudcli` scope belongs to other maintainers — it can never be
 *      published from here, so a regression back to that name fails the run at the publish step
 *      (after the tag is already made) rather than doing nothing.
 *   2. `.release-it.json` publishes to npm (`npm.publish=true`, `--access public`) in addition to
 *      cutting the GitHub Release, on `develop`, pushing to the `yaleh` remote.
 *   3. `release.yml` authenticates that publish with the `NPM_TOKEN` secret via
 *      `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`. Trusted publishing (OIDC) is deliberately NOT used: this fork is not
 *      configured for it on the registry side.
 *   4. No user-facing install/upgrade command in the repository points at the upstream scope —
 *      every one of them must name `@yalehwang/cloudcli`, or the fork ships users a command that
 *      installs somebody else's package.
 *   5. `desktop-release.yml` builds Windows only. There is no Apple signing certificate, so a
 *      re-added `build-macos` job makes `publish.needs` wait on a job that can never go green, and
 *      a re-added `.dmg` assertion fails the publish step on an asset nobody built.
 *
 * This is a static guard, not an integration test: it reads the files and asserts the shape. It
 * cannot prove the pipeline runs (that is the task's human-gated AC), only that the decisions have
 * not silently reverted.
 *
 * WHAT IT PRINTS. The readings named by the criterion are printed unconditionally, before the
 * assertions, so a red run still shows which reading was wrong:
 *
 *   pkg.name=@yalehwang/cloudcli  npm.publish=true  auth.env=NODE_AUTH_TOKEN  legacy.upgradeCmds=0
 *   requireBranch=develop  pushRepo=yaleh  macos.jobs=0  dmg.refs=0

 *                        a user would ever be told to run.
 *  - `SELF`              this guard spells the forbidden pattern in `UPSTREAM_NAME` above, so it
 *                        necessarily mentions it.
