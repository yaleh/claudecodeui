/**
 * The controls for `scripts/e2e-data-dir-retention.mjs` — the reclaimer that keeps the e2e data
 * directories from eating the user's quota.
 *
 * WHY THESE CASES EXIST. The module deletes things, and every way it could delete the wrong thing is
 * a way the defect it closes comes back in a worse form. Each case below is therefore aimed at one
 * half of what has to hold:
 *
 *   AC1 keeps-entry-younger-than-ttl        — an entry inside the TTL is considered and kept
 *   AC1 selects-entry-older-than-ttl        — the same entry one TTL later is selected
 *   AC1 never-selects-non-run-dir-name      — another tool's cache in the same parent is never a candidate
 *   AC1 never-selects-the-excluded-current-dir — the run's own directory survives being over-age
 *   AC1 invalid-ttl-selects-nothing         — an unreadable bound reclaims nothing, never everything
 *   AC1 missing-parent-is-empty-not-throwing — housekeeping cannot fail a run
 *   AC4 the side effects, on a real fixture  — what survives, asserted on the disk rather than on a plan
 *
 * THE READINGS, NOT THE PROMISES. Nothing here asserts that the module "would" keep something: the
 * pure cases read the two halves of the decision (selected *and* kept) so that "not selected" cannot
 * be satisfied by "never considered", and the fixture case reads the filesystem after the sweep so
 * that "survives" means the directory is still there. The TTL's own value is read back and bounded
 * rather than restated, and the prefix this module reclaims by is checked against the name the
 * selector *actually creates*, because a drift between those two spellings would leave every run
 * directory unreclaimable while every case here still passed.
