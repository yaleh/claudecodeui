/**
 * The falsification controls for scripts/asr-trim-capability-check.mjs (AC-135).
 *
 * Each case below first runs the probe against an UNMUTATED fixture and requires green, then
 * applies exactly one mutation and requires red on the check whose name the case carries. Both
 * halves matter: only the second proves the probe notices the fake form, and only the first proves
 * the red came from the mutation rather than from a probe that is red for every input.
 *
 * The fixture is built at run time, in a temporary directory, OUT OF THE SHIPPING FILES — copied,
 * never re-typed. A hand-written stub would prove the probe reads the stub, and a fixture checked
 * into the repository would be a second declaration of the capability the uniqueness check is
 * looking for.
 *
 * The cases are the two fake forms the criterion names, one for each direction the composition can
 * break from:
 *
 *   · the decision stays in the client and the capability is never read (AC-135 AC3's fake) —
 *     `single-source`;
 *   · the client reads the capability, and answers 裁不裁 by hand beside the read point —
 *     `single-source` again, from the other end;
 *   · the default is changed to "do not trim" (AC-135 AC2's fake) — `default`;
 *   · the read point is gutted so the capability is read but changes nothing (AC-135 AC5's empty
 *     reading) — `read-point`;
 *   · a non-destructive declaration with no experiment to point at (AC-135 AC7) — `discipline`;
 *   · the same red reached the other way: the fixture is complete except that the third registered
 *     provider's own record is gone, and the two records the other providers name are still there —
 *     `discipline`, which is what proves the check is per provider rather than per tree.
 *
 * Run with: node --test scripts/asr-trim-capability-check.test.mjs
