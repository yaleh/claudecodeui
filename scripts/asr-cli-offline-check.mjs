 * AC-131's criterion: the command line's two offline paths, and the launch method underneath them.

 *
 * WHAT IS READ, AND WHAT IS NOT
 *
 * Every reading below is something the RUN produced, never something the command said about itself.
 * A `network=none` line, a `redacted=all` line or a `launch=tsx` line would all be self-reports, and
 * a self-report is exactly what a flag's own implementation is free to keep printing after it stops
 * being true. So:
 *
 *   zero network     the injected double's CALL LOG is empty. The double is a module (`--fetch-impl`)
 *                    that appends one line per invocation, so "a call happened" is observable and
 *                    its absence is a reading rather than a promise. `dry-run made N calls` / the
 *                    `offline calls=` field say how many happened when it was not zero.
 *   redaction        the criterion's own constant key does not appear in the raw stdout BYTES, no
 *                    32-byte window of the synthetic clip appears there either, and a
 *                    `sha256=<64hex>` line DOES — recomputed here from the clip on disk, so an
 *                    implementation that printed nothing scores the same as one that never read the
 *                    file. That third half is what makes the first two mean "redacted" rather than
 *                    "silent".
 *   replay           the transcript the `--offline` arm writes is compared BYTE FOR BYTE against the
 *                    `expect` recorded in the fixture, and the strict arm is required to fail with
 *                    the recorded code. The parse behind it is the shipping adapter's; this file
 *                    spells neither the endpoint nor a multipart field, and a grep for the
 *                    recogniser's path under `scripts/` finds nothing.
 *   launch           derived from the CLI's own raw evidence (`execArgv=<json>`, `tsxEnv=<bool>`) on
 *                    two arms of the SAME file: `npx tsx` must report `tsx`, and bare `node` must
 *                    not be able to run it at all. The bare-node arm is required to be BLOCKED, not
 *                    merely non-tsx — see the note at the arm for why that stricter reading is the
 *                    one the task's own definition of done forces.
 *
 * THE EMPTY READING IS A FAILURE
 *
 * A missing recording, a `--dry-run` that printed nothing, a CLI that is not there: each is its own
 * red with its own token, never a silent exit 0. This repository has paid for the other shape once.
