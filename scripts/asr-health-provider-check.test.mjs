/**
 * The falsification controls for scripts/asr-health-provider-check.mjs (AC8).
 *
 * Three ways the health-and-provider change could have been faked, one at a time. Each case
 * first runs the probe against an UNMUTATED fixture and requires green, then applies exactly one
 * mutation and requires the probe to go red on the reading that mutation breaks. Both halves
 * matter: only the second proves the probe notices the fake, and only the first proves the red
 * came from the mutation rather than from a probe that is red for everything.
 *
 * The three, and the reading each one must move:
 *   1. the health reading still only looks at the server's environment   -> health-user-configured
 *   2. an unregistered id quietly becomes the default provider           -> proxy-unknown-provider
 *   3. the `configured` field is renamed out from under its consumer      -> configured-field-present
 *
 * The fixture is built at run time, in a temporary directory, OUT OF THE SHIPPING FILES —
 * copied, never re-typed. A fixture checked into the repository would be a second copy of the
 * implementation that nothing keeps in step, and a hand-written stub would prove the probe reads
 * the stub rather than this repository's real service.
 *
 * Run with: node --test scripts/asr-health-provider-check.test.mjs
