# 本脚本原先对 `--test-concurrency` **照单全收**（只挡空值/非数字/0），于是调用方给多大就
# 并发多大。fan-in 的 runner 会按 nproc 推一个值 splice 进来（本机 128 核 ⇒ 请求 128），
# 而本仓服务端有 101 个逐文件进程：2026-09-20 16:23Z 那轮 fan-in 的 log 里，把 101 条
# `__PERFILE__` 行的 `[end_ms - duration_ms, end_ms]` 当区间做最大重叠扫描得
# **server_max_concurrent=101**（全部同时在跑），逐文件耗时**中位 46,758ms**；对照本机
# 安静态 N=100 的中位 1,399ms —— **中位涨 33×，几乎每个文件都被垫到 ~47s 的地板**。
# 判红因此落在「每次不同的文件」上（gap-model-env-kind-explanations 连红三次：7.3s /
# 44.4s / 56.3s 三个不同文件，失败文件还走各自的内部截止路径），而「每次不同」正是
# 机制指纹 —— 不是那些测试各自的缺陷。
#
# 上限 = 16，**由实测推出**（读数与复算命令见 scripts/server-phase-concurrency-check.sh
# 的 SLOPE_TABLE 与完成记录的坡度表）：
#   · 吞吐膝点：N=4 墙钟 30.0s → N=16 14.2s（−53%）；N=16 → N=100 只从 14.2s 走到 14.4s
#     （+1.4%，落在噪声内）。16 以上加并发只加压力、不换吞吐。
#   · 同时起步数：夹在 16 ⇒ 服务端阶段同时在跑的进程从 101 降到 16，而**实测零吞吐代价**；
#     那正是上面那条 ~47s 地板赖以形成的量。
#   · 不取更低（例如 4）：N=4 要多付约 16s 墙钟/轮，夹取不该比膝点更狠。

# this tree's own tasks/, and it distinguishes the two cases instead of demanding --for-task

# WITHOUT one must run its own delivered checker (scripts/*.sh) — for that task --for-task would
# resolve to 0 files and exit 0 on the thin path, i.e. a green that cannot go red. `done` /
# `superseded` history is out of scope. Exit 1 (not 2): a red here is a verdict, not a usage error.
#
# The guard's stdout (its scan/PASS/FAIL lines) is forwarded to stderr: this script's stdout is a
# contract surface — `__PERFILE__` / `__PERFILE_KIND__` rows and the dry-run line, plus (under

# ── __BEGIN_WATCHDOG__ liveness watchdogs ────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY: nothing above bounds this invocation. `timeout(1)` bounds each *server file*
# and the one vitest run, but a hang that survives those (a stuck stage, a child that
# ignores TERM, a bash-level deadlock, `timeout` absent or non-GNU) leaves the call
# sitting there forever — and this is the one failure class no layer downstream can
# see, because it is not red, it is SILENT. quay's own record of that shape is two
# hangs of 33.7 and 199.5 minutes, both ended by a human running `kill -TERM -- -<pgid>`.
#
# These two guards answer ONE question — is it still moving? — and nothing else. They
# do not decide whether to retry, and they do not change any verdict: they only end
# something that is already hung, which is why they can be unconditionally on.
#
#   max-runtime   the whole invocation has an upper bound
#   silence       no progress for this long => hung
#
# THRESHOLDS ARE MEASURED, NOT GUESSED (quay SPEC-suite-speed AC3: no threshold before
# the data exists). Readings taken on this machine 2026-09-20 with this script's own
# `QUAY_SUITE_WATCHDOG_TRACE=1` (which reprints them, so they can be re-derived instead of
# re-guessed — that is the whole reason the switch exists):
#
#   full suite, alone            wall  53.9s .. 59.0s   max progress gap 6.0s
#   2 full suites concurrently   wall  67.4s (worst)     max progress gap 8.0s
#
# THE ARITHMETIC LIVES IN scripts/suite-hang-watchdog-check.sh, so these two numbers can be
# re-derived rather than re-guessed, and so a stale default cannot sit here quietly:
#
#   bash scripts/suite-hang-watchdog-check.sh --measure     (re-runs the three suites, ~2 min)
#
# Both recipes are "multiply the worst reading, then round UP to a whole minute", and that
# checker fails if what ships below the recipe's floor ever falls under it.
#
# Rounding UP only ever makes a guard more permissive, which is the direction that is safe
# to be sloppy in, because the two failure directions are NOT symmetric: too high leaves a
# hang for a human to notice (what happens today), too low kills a healthy suite that was
# merely slowed down by load and turns a load artifact into a lost run.
#
#   max-runtime  660s = 9 x the worst concurrent wall clock on record (9 x 67.4s = 606s ->
#                660s), and 11.2x the quiet one. The suite is allowed a whole extra per-file
#                bound (QUAY_TEST_FILE_TIMEOUT, 600s) of slack past the worst concurrent
#                reading; past that it is doing ~10 runs' worth of work and is not coming
#                back. This is the backstop, not the usual trigger.
#   silence      240s = 30 x the worst concurrent progress gap (30 x 8.0s = 240s), and 40x
#                the quiet one. Concurrency degraded that gap by only 1.33x here, so the
#                margin absorbs it ~22x over. Note this sits BELOW the 600s per-file bound,
#                so it ends a single stuck file in 240s rather than letting timeout(1) take
#                600s — deliberately, since a file that has produced nothing at all for
#                240s is a hang from the outside. The slowest real file in the quiet run
#                took 12.7s, so nothing healthy is within 19x of this line; raise
#                QUAY_SUITE_SILENCE_MS if a legitimately slow file ever needs longer.
#
# On firing, the guard ends this process tree and this script exits non-zero with a
# `suite-watchdog: ABORT guard=... reason=timeout|hung threshold_ms=... elapsed_ms=...
# silent_ms=...` line in the report. It terminates; it never re-judges.

# WHY. Every child's full stdout/stderr is written into $TMP, and the exit path below used to
# `rm -rf "$TMP"` it unconditionally — so a red run left behind nothing but the 300-character
# `first_error` excerpt per file. The 2026-09-25 09:17 fan-in suite is the shape this removes:
# 12 of its 14 failures were, verbatim,
#   `not ok - <file>: no result file was written for this file — its process died without reporting`
# and with $TMP gone, whether those processes were OOM-killed, signalled, or hung is not
# recoverable from anything left on disk. This block copies $TMP into a per-run directory BEFORE
# that rm, so a red run leaves behind the evidence that explains it.
#
# It only PRESERVES output; it never judges. classify_failure_kind() and first_error() are
# untouched, no failure line is added or reworded, and the exit status is still decided by
# `[ "$FAIL" -eq 0 ] && [ "$UNCLASSIFIED" -eq 0 ]` at the end of this script — nothing here can
# turn a green run red or a red run green.
#
#   red            the run's own verdict was non-zero   => keep (default)
#   aborted        a guard or an external signal ended it => keep (this is the run whose
#                  evidence is scarcest: the units that never reported are exactly the ones
#                  whose output exists only in $TMP)
#   any other non-zero exit (a `set -u` death, a signal that never reached the report) => keep
#                  — see the suite_cleanup fallback
#   green          => nothing is copied and $TMP is removed as before, so any number of green
#                  runs leaves no growth behind
#   --keep-logs <dir> | QUAY_SUITE_KEEP_LOGS=1 => keep even when green (the explicit switch)
#
# BOUNDED, because "keep the evidence" must not become "fill the disk": one kept file is cut at
# PER_FILE_LOG_CAP and the whole directory at TOTAL_LOG_CAP, and a file that was cut gets a
# `<name>.truncated` sidecar saying how many bytes were dropped. The one-line `# suite-logs:`
# record printed next to the failures repeats both facts, so a reader of the fan-in log can tell
# a complete capture from a partial one without opening anything.
#
# The plan arrays are re-declared at the point they are filled; they are named here too because
# suite_keep_logs() reads them and runs from an EXIT trap, and a read of an unset array under
# `set -u` would abort the very trap that exists to preserve the evidence.

# ── longest-first server dispatch (gap-suite-server-dispatch-longest-first-and-parallel-static-stages) ──
#
# WHY. The server phase runs one process per file under a concurrency ceiling, so its wall clock is
# the SPAN of the launch schedule, not the sum of durations: an alphabetically collected list starts
# the slowest file LATE, and the phase then ends on that file's own tail. Round 636 (2026-10-05T23:24Z,
# green, 232 server files) had perFile span 180.7s while its theoretical floor was
# max(128.9s longest file, 1347.4s/16 = 84.2s) = 128.9s; voice-error-classification.false-forms.test.ts
# (128.9s) only started 52s in N=16 (its mean concurrency was 7.4). Ordering by a committed per-file
# duration baseline starts the long files first and pulls the span toward that floor.
#
# FAIL-OPEN IS THE CONTRACT, not a nicety. The baseline is an optimisation; the suite must not depend
# on it. Missing, empty, unreadable, or carrying even ONE unparseable line => the collected list is
# left byte-for-byte today's alphabetical order and the exit code is unchanged. A bad baseline can
# therefore never lose or duplicate a file, nor turn a green suite red.
#
# The baseline is a DATA file (scripts/suite-duration-baseline.tsv), deliberately not a script: a new
# scripts/*.mjs would be swept by scripts/tsconfig.json (allowJs+checkJs+strict) and red the whole
# suite via `npm run typecheck`.
