 * The run's own ceilings — the bounds above which nothing else in this file bounds anything.
 *
 * The gate that runs this criterion kills it at 60s and records the kill as `verdict: fail`, the same shape a
 * real failure has, so a run that crosses 60s is a red nobody can read. Two ceilings already exist under these
 * and neither covers the whole run: `webServer[].timeout` bounds only the wait *after* a server is spawned, and
 * the filter spec's own `test.describe.configure({ timeout: 120_000 })` raises the per-test budget to twice the
 * gate's cap. What is left over is everything outside both — most sharply Playwright's *pre-spawn* availability
 * probe (the note above), which asks each webServer url once with no deadline of its own, so a listener that
 * completes the TCP handshake and then never writes a byte makes it wait forever.
 *
 * The unboundedness is not spread evenly, so neither is the bound. Before both webServers answer, a run is on
 * the path nothing bounds, and `BOOT_CEILING_MS` bounds it there. Once both answer, the run is inside browser
 * launch and the cases, where the spec's own per-test timeout is the bound that already exists — so that stage
 * gets `RUN_CEILING_MS` instead, the largest value that still beats the gate's kill. A watchdog that used the
 * tight value for both stages would kill a perfectly healthy run of any spec in this checkout that load had
 * merely slowed past it — a bound lower than a sibling spec's own runtime turns a load artifact into a lost
 * run, and one already did: `e2e/voice-trim.spec.ts` runs 41.1-41.3s here and was killed mid-case at 45s.
 *
 * Both fire by *explaining themselves*: each reads back which stage the run is stuck in, writes one line naming
 * that stage and the milliseconds elapsed, ends any server process this run left behind, and exits non-zero. A
 * watchdog that only said "too slow" would leave the next reader exactly where the 60s kill does.
 *
 * The values are derived rather than guessed. A quiet run's stages measure ~0.6s config evaluation and seeding,
 * ~2.9s server boot, ~0.9s vite, ~8s browser launch plus `beforeAll`, and ~12s across the five cases — ~24s in
 * total, and a run under six concurrent sibling specs measured 23.6s. `BOOT_CEILING_MS` must clear every boot
 * that is already bounded (2 × 30s webServer waits, but serially — the first expiry ends the run, so ~31s), and
 * it is 9× the quiet boot. `SINGLE_SPEC_CEILING_MS` must clear the longest healthy run in this checkout
 * (voice-trim, ~42s) and still land its line before the gate's kill: 55s + the 2s diagnosis probe + ~0.6s of
 * process start-up puts the line on stdout at ~57.6s, ~2.4s inside 60s.
 *
 * The 0.6s config-evaluation-and-seeding reading is re-measured when a new seed is added, because a seeding
 * stage that grew could push a run's start past the ceilings above. Adding `seedTranscriptJumpTranscript` (a
 * 1200-turn, 1.66 MB JSONL) measured, as the median of 7 fresh config evaluations on 2026-10-04: 0.465s without
 * it, 0.472s with it — a ~7ms delta, against the 2s the seed task budgets for this stage.
 *
 * `seedForkAnchorTranscript` (a 7-row JSONL plus one `realpathSync`) was measured the same way on 2026-10-07:
 * a median 496ms without it and 491ms with it — a delta inside the spread of the seven samples themselves
 * (464-561ms), which is the reading: this seed is smaller than the noise floor of the stage it joins, not
 * merely smaller than a budget.
 *
 * The run ceiling itself is the sum of the selected specs' budgets, computed above; for the one-file invocation
 * the gate makes, that sum is `SINGLE_SPEC_CEILING_MS` and nothing about it changed.

 *
 * ONE DEPARTURE FROM THE SEEDS ABOVE: this transcript is written into `<projects>/<sanitize(cwd)>/`
 * rather than a readable directory name. The directory a transcript sits in is not what the app reads
 * it from — the claude provider scans every subdirectory of `~/.claude/projects` — so every other seed

 * exactly that. Naming the directory anything else makes the fork report "Session not found in project
 * directory" while the transcript is sitting right there. `cwd` is therefore the *realpath* of the
 * workspace, and the directory name is that sanitized — the same value the SDK will compute, which
 * also keeps the fork's own output landing beside its source.
 *
 * The shape is two turns. The first is a turn that calls a tool — an assistant thinking row, an
 * assistant tool_use row, and the user tool_result row answering it — so a fork cut at its answer has
 * a tool call behind it to leave behind (a dangling tool_use is exactly what that is for). The second

/**
 * Fills this run's own dependency cache with a copy of the shared one, so `viteCacheDir` starts hot.
 *
 * Isolation is about who may *write* the cache, not about paying for a pre-bundle. Seeding by copy keeps the
 * run's start-up where it was: measured on this checkout, a cold pre-bundle adds ~1.2 s to the criterion, so
 * the copy is cheap insurance and every failure below simply degrades to that cold path rather than failing
 * the run. That is also why the copy is not verified beyond what is written here — a run that silently
 * optimizes from scratch is correct, only slower.
 *
 * The copy has to be repaired on the way in, but only in one of its two path fields. Vite stores both as
 * paths *relative to the deps directory that wrote them* (`stringifyDepsOptimizerMetadata`) and resolves them
 * back against whichever directory it reads them from (`parseDepsOptimizerMetadata`) — so both have to be
 * right for the directory they now live in, and the two need opposite treatment:
 *
 *   `file` is the optimized chunk itself, which sits *inside* the deps directory (`getOptimizedDepPath`
 *   builds it from that directory), so it is stored as a bare name like `react.js` and the copy brought it
 *   along. Left alone it is already correct, and it must be: resolving it against the directory it came from
 *   would point this run's chunk requests back into the shared directory, so the run would read chunk bytes
 *   from the very thing it is supposed to be isolated from — a sibling's re-optimization could then rename
 *   them away mid-run and the 504s would be back.
 *
 *   `src` is the module in `node_modules` the chunk was built from, which the copy did *not* bring along
 *   (`../../react/index.js`, reaching out of the deps directory into the checkout). Relocated verbatim it
 *   would resolve against this run's throwaway directory instead — naming nothing, and making a nested
 *   dependency (`react-dom > scheduler`) unmatchable in `tryOptimizedResolve`, the one place a cached `src`
 *   is genuinely consulted. Recomputing it for the new directory is what makes the seeded metadata say
 *   exactly what Vite would have written had it optimized into this directory itself.
 *
 * This is not a rare path: the seed is only usable at all when the shared cache was written by *this* root
 * (`configHash` includes the root), and that is precisely the case where Vite trusts these fields.
 *
 * Ownership matters: workers re-evaluate this file, and the cache in their `dataDir` is the one the run's own
 * server is serving from — so the caller runs this once, before the servers start, and never again.

 * The specs that drive the debug agent, and the fixture home the server gets when one of them is selected.
 *
 * The debug agent's provider is not a product provider: `provider.registry.ts` writes its key only while the gate
 * is open (`DEBUG_AGENT` + `DEBUG_AGENT_HOME`), so a server booted without those variables cannot arm a scenario,
 * cannot resolve provider `debug`, and mounts no control plane. Turning the gate on for every run would put a
 * fixture-writing provider and its HTTP face in front of every other spec's server — the face is authenticated but
 * it is still a surface nothing else asked for. `selectedSpecFiles()` is the seam that keeps that from happening:
 * the selection is this invocation's own command line, so the gate opens for exactly the runs that name one of the specs
 * below and the env object is byte-identical to what it was for every other selection.
 *
 * The home is a directory of its own under `dataDir`, and NOT `dataDir` itself, which it used to be. The reason is
 * a collision rather than a preference. `getDebugAgentProjectsRoot()` answers `<home>/.claude/projects`, and the
 * server's `HOME` is `dataDir` — so `home = dataDir` put the fixture transcripts inside `<HOME>/.claude/projects`,
 * which is exactly the tree the *claude* provider scans and watches. Both indexers then claimed every armed
 * transcript and the claude one, running from the watcher after the arming call, won: the row ended up stored
 * under provider `claude` while carrying the `resident` mode the debug seam had written, and `POST
 * /api/session-hosts/:sessionId/start` resolved the claude host driver for it — a driver that refuses to open a
 * resident host on demand, because for claude a resident host is born in the driver's run entry. The criterion
 * could not start the process it had armed.
 *
 * A home of its own keeps the two readers apart, and nothing is lost by it: arming indexes the transcript itself
 * (`synchronizeFile`) rather than waiting for a disk scan, so the session row, its project link and its stored
 * mode all exist regardless of where the file sits. The old comment's worry — "a home anywhere else would write
 * transcripts no listing could see" — describes a reader that no longer exists.
