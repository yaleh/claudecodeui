/*
 * The continuous voice path's own reading, read off a real page.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT. The composer, the hook, the segmenter, the shared VAD, the request
 * builder and the reading module are the shipping code. Three things are stand-ins, each named where
 * it lives:
 *
 *   · the microphone, because no CI machine has one and none could be told to say an exact timeline.
 *     An init script replaces `AudioContext`/`AudioWorkletNode` and `getUserMedia` with a graph the
 *     spec drives (`__voiceFake.speak(3)` feeds three seconds of speech and a `speechStart`), so
 *     everything downstream of the audio thread runs unchanged. The same fake context forwards
 *     `decodeAudioData` to a real context, so a chosen file still decodes for real.
 *
 *   · the recogniser. The settings name `dashscope-omni`, whose declaration is `proxy-only`, so the
 *     client posts to this app's `/api/voice/transcribe`; Playwright intercepts that route, so no
 *     request leaves the machine and no credential is spent.
 *
 *   · the corpus. `corpus/long/L3-sparse` and `L4-nonstop` are real human speech outside the repo.
 *     A missing sample is NAMED and fails — a run that quietly measured nothing is the one failure a
 *     measurement may not have.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED. Every number comes from `window.__voiceLive`, the object the hook publishes at
 * the end of an input under the debug switch — never from a re-computation in this file. The A/B is
 * the same bytes over the same entry with the VAD on and with `voiceVad=off`, so the difference the
 * reading reports is a real difference between two runs, not an assertion about one.
 *
 * EVERY LEG NAMES BOTH SWITCHES. `voiceVad` — like `voiceDebug` and the numeric switches — is
 * REMEMBERED in `localStorage`, so a leg that named only `voiceDebug=1` would inherit whatever arm
 * the previous leg left behind and read the wrong thing. Naming `voiceVad=1` explicitly is what
 * makes "the VAD-on leg" mean the VAD really ran.
