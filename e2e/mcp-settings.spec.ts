// Real Chromium against a real backend and a real Vite client, twice: once with `MCP_ENABLED` on and once with it
// off. Playwright's shared `webServer` carries one fixed environment, so this spec starts its OWN server + Vite pair
// per state on kernel-assigned ports, against a throwaway data directory — the same shape `scripts/resident-smoke.mjs`
// and `scripts/voice-capture-process-check.mjs` use. Nothing about the backend is stubbed: the settings page asks the
// state's own server over its own Vite `/api` proxy, and the scope reading below is a real `GET /api/oauth/token-info`
// carrying the token the form really issued.
//
// The build under test is the worktree's own source, served by Vite (not a possibly-stale `dist/`), so a change to
// `McpGatewaySection.tsx` or `AccessTokensSection.tsx` is what the browser renders.
//
// The startup path is bounded in the same two levers its sibling specs use (`e2e/access-tokens-settings.spec.ts`,
// `e2e/model-library.spec.ts`): a per-state client warm-up before any page exists, and a single bounded navigation
// guard. The lever exists because the trigger is OUTSIDE this repo: a host-level `net::ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED` (docker
// /veth churn on the runner) aborts this app's in-flight module requests as a batch, the module graph never executes,
// React never mounts, and `#username` never appears — an unbounded 30s `toBeVisible` wait turned that transient into
// a red. What this file fixes is the *response* (unbounded wait → bounded replay of a fresh document), not the
// trigger: the guard's stability rests on replay, never on the host network change going away.
