   * Walks the first-run wizard to the app shell, state-driven and bounded.

   * The walk this replaces was two hard-wired clicks — `Next`, then `Complete Setup` — with no deadline of their
   * own. A client reload mid-run (Vite answers a re-optimization by pushing a full reload) remounts the app and
   * resets the wizard to its first step, so `Complete Setup` no longer exists; Playwright's `click` then
   * auto-waited for it until playwright.config.ts's watchdog killed the browser at 55s, and the red landed as
   * `Channel closed` instead of on any of the case's own (a)–(e) assertions.
   *
   * So this walk never commits to a step it saw once: each turn re-reads the page and drives whichever step is
   * actually on screen — the account form while it is up, then the git step (filling only a field the wizard left
   * blank, so a value the run already committed is never overwritten), then the final step. Every probe and every
   * click is bounded by the remaining budget; a click that loses its document to a reload is a turn that simply
   * re-reads; and the app shell ends the walk. When the budget is spent the walk ends the run *here*, by name,
   * with the page's own evidence — before the watchdog, where a reader can see which step never advanced.
   *
   * The app shell is not by itself proof the walk is over. `AuthContext` initialises `hasCompletedOnboarding` to
   * `true`, and `register` commits the session before it awaits `/api/user/onboarding-status`, so a freshly created
   * account shows the real shell for exactly as long as that one read takes before the wizard replaces it. A walk
   * that trusted the first sighting returned on that transient, and the case then failed on the wizard underneath.
   * Only a shell with no wizard ever in front of it (a database already onboarded) or one that follows this walk's
   * own `Complete Setup` is the real thing; any other sighting is that transient, and the walk waits it out.
