// interrupted, the document is replaced under the navigation, and the case times out on a page that
// never mounted — reported as a bare locator timeout that names neither the url nor the status.
//
// The trigger (this run's own dependency optimization) is decided by the cache, not by this file. What
// is inside it is the *response*: a bounded client warm-up and a bounded navigation probe, the two
// levers the sibling specs already carry (`e2e/resident-running-view.spec.ts`,
// `e2e/resident-status-bar.spec.ts`). Neither is invented here.
//
// The guard replays a navigation and fails loudly when it cannot land; it never treats "not landed" as
// "good enough". Written the other way — probe times out, carry on — the case would wait out its own
// budget on a blank document and the run would still cross the gate's 60s, which is what this task's

 * `/@fs/<cacheDir>/deps/<dep>.js?v=<hash>` urls, and that url only answers 200 once the optimizer has

 *

 * made, made first. It is here rather than in playwright.config.ts's `globalSetup` because Playwright
 * resolves every `globalSetup` entry as a *script* (a path that must default-export the function), so an
 * inline warm-up there is neither type-legal nor loadable, and this task's write surface allows no new file.
