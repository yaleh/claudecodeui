/**
 * The mobile workspace header and composer layout, read as a matrix in a real Chromium.
 *
 * Four implementation tasks each promised a shape for one part of the mobile chrome: the workspace header collapses
 * to a single row with one selector instead of a tablist, the composer footer stays on one line with everything
 * else behind a "more" menu, a recording's replay pair gets its own row *below* the textarea rather than pushing
 * the footer apart, and the running state shows exactly one interrupt control instead of two. Each of those was
 * read once, by hand, while it was being built. This file is the permanent reading: six viewports on both sides of
 * the 768 breakpoint, four states each, in one run against the real backend and the real Vite client.
 *
 * Why a matrix rather than one case per shape: the shapes are conditions, not constants. A bound like "the footer
 * may be 57px" is only meaningful at the width where the layout is supposed to be single-row, and a rule like
 * "the replay pair sits below the footer" is only meaningful once a clip exists. So each cell declares its width
 * and its state, asserts the *premise* that would make its reading meaningless (the viewport really is that wide,
 * the running state really appeared, both clips really exist), and only then asserts the geometry — a cell that
 * skipped the premise would pass against a clamped viewport or a recording that never produced a clip.
 *
 * Nothing here is a stand-in for the app. The recordings are real: Chromium is launched with a fake audio device
 * whose samples come from the WAV `playwright.config.ts` writes before the servers boot, the app's own recorder
 * and trim run, and the recogniser is a local HTTP server answering `/audio/transcriptions` the way the shipped
 * voice-trim spec does. The running state is the one exception, and it is a stand-in for the *transport*, never
 * for the consumer: an init script wraps `window.WebSocket` and hands the app one frame on its own chat socket,
 * exactly the frame shape the server sends (`kind: 'status'` with `canInterrupt`), so what the cells read is the
 * app's own reaction to a real frame arriving on a real socket.
 *
 * The readings are Chromium's viewport and touch emulation, not a real device, and the PWA safe-area inset is not
 * in effect in headless: `MOBILE_HEADER_MAX` is the bound *without* a safe area.
 *
 * Two measurement traps this file has to avoid, both found by reading the app rather than assuming it:
 *
 * The recogniser stand-in has to answer. With a base URL that refuses the connection, the app renders its voice
 * error notice inside the footer's right-hand control cluster, which grows the footer's scroll extent by 32px at
 * 320 — a *failing backend* moving the very number `noOverflow` asserts. A dead recogniser would red this matrix
 * for a reason that has nothing to do with layout, so the stand-in answers every transcription.
 *
 * The workspace dialog animates in. Radix mounts it with an entrance scale, so a reading taken on the first visible
 * frame measures the animation instead of the layout: the probe caught a 44px entry at 42.24px (44 x 0.96) and an
 * earlier one at 43px, either of which reads as a touch target below the declared minimum. The dialog's entries are
 * therefore polled until they settle before their height is used as a touch-target reading.
