// Real Chromium against the real backend + Vite client started by playwright.config.ts (isolated data dir).
//
// The subject is the Conversations feed — the sidebar's recents list, `GET /api/providers/sessions/recent` —
// and what it does with a transcript that appears on disk *while the user is sitting on it*. That feed is
// patched in place from `session_upserted` deltas, and a reload of the same feed is filtered server-side by
// the owning project's session-name rules. The reported bug is the gap between the two: the reload dropped a
// worker session, the live list kept it, so a rule the user had already saved looked broken until they
// navigated away and back. This spec drives that exact sequence and judges the live list against a real
// reload of itself, so what is asserted is an equivalence between what the app shows and what the app's own
// server would return — not a restatement of the client's rule code.
//
// Why this is not a case inside e2e/session-filter.spec.ts: that spec is about the *Projects* list, and the
// two lists do not answer the same question. The Projects list judges with exemptions — the session the user
// has selected, the sessions flagged as needing attention — because those rows are the user's own working set.
// The Conversations feed has no selection and deliberately applies none of them, because the reload it has to
// match applies none: `/sessions/recent` filters on the project's rules and nothing else. A live view that
// kept a row the reload drops is the bug; being the more permissive of the two is precisely how it happened.
//
// Every session this spec filters on is written by the spec itself, mid-run, through the file watcher — that
// is the path under test. The one exception is the seed: a row has to be on screen before the first write, or
// there would be no way to tell "never appeared" from "not loaded yet". It is seeded before the server boots
// by playwright.config.ts, in its own workspace.
//
// Nothing here stubs a request. The rule is entered through the sidebar's own filter editor and saved through
// the app's own PUT — never over the API, because the value of the case is that the entry point really works.
