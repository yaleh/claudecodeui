// Real Chromium against the real backend + Vite client started by playwright.config.ts (isolated data dir),
// recording through the app's own voice button. The recorder is the browser's own: Chromium is launched with a
// fake audio device whose samples come from the WAV playwright.config.ts wrote before the servers booted, so
// `getUserMedia` hands `MediaRecorder` a real stream and the app's own hook encodes what it hears.
//
// What this file adds over the two voice specs beside it: those point the voice settings at a real local HTTP
// recogniser, and the settings page is never touched — they seed the legacy `voiceConfig` blob. Here the
// SETTINGS PAGE is the only way the provider is chosen and the credential is typed, and the recogniser is
// intercepted in the browser instead of stood up on a socket. Both differences are the reading this file
// exists for: "the settings page really selects a provider and really sends the user's own address and key
// with it, and the recording then takes the route that provider's own declaration names".
//
// INTERCEPTION VS A REAL SERVICE, said once because it bounds every claim below: `page.route` answers
// `/api/voice/transcribe` and the aliyuncs host in the browser. Nothing here is the real DashScope service,
// and no request leaves the machine. What IS real is everything on this side of the interception: the
// settings form, the whole-document PUT the server stores, the health payload the client routes on, and the
// upload the capture chain actually produced — which is what makes "the page went through the proxy and never
// touched the workspace host" a statement about the app rather than about the harness.
//
// THE TWO COUNTS THAT MAKE EACH OTHER CREDIBLE: the DashScope leg reads zero requests to the aliyuncs host and
// the control leg — a provider the payload declares as directly connected, given the SAME address — reads at
// least one. A harness that counted nothing anywhere, or hardcoded the zero, could not produce the second.

 * The dependency request is the one that carries the proof, and it is why the step is not just "warm the
 * cache". The imports of a transformed module are already rewritten to this run's own
 * `/@fs/<cacheDir>/deps/<dep>.js?v=<hash>` urls, and that url only answers 200 once the optimizer has
 * committed the bundle: while the bundle is still being built the request is held, and a url carrying a hash
 * from a superseded run is exactly what a page receives `504 Outdated Optimize Dep` for. Vite reacts to a
 * (re)optimization committed after it has started serving by pushing `full-reload` to every connected client
 * (`node_modules/vite/dist/client/client.mjs`'s `case "full-reload"`), which replaces the document whole — the
 * way this criterion lost its page *after* the account form had already rendered. So a 200 there means the
 * page below will not race the optimizer, and the wizard the criterion drives will be driven on the document
 * it was navigated to.
 *
 * The private cache is what makes the race possible at all, and it is also why the seed in
 * `playwright.config.ts` is not enough on its own: the seed is only usable when the shared cache was written
 * by *this* root, and when it is not, the private directory is built from scratch *while the server is
 * already answering* — inside the measurement window. This step is where that build is paid.
 *
 * Why the warm-up lives here rather than in `playwright.config.ts`'s `globalSetup`, which is where this
 * defect's proposal put it: Playwright resolves every `globalSetup` entry as a *script* — `resolveScript()`
 * turns it into a path and the file must default-export the function — so an inline warm-up is neither
 * type-legal nor loadable, and this task's write surface allows no new file. `beforeAll`, before
 * `browser.newContext()`, is the earliest point inside the criterion's own startup path, and it is strictly
 * before any page exists — the same requests the page would have made, made first.
 *
 * Every step is bounded, including each request: a client that accepts the connection and then never answers
 * fails here, by name, with the url and the status, rather than waiting out a timeout further up.
