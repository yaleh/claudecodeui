/**
 * The activity dock when the server stops answering.
 *
 * What this file is *for*. The dock used to be a local table plus a local clock:
 * it kept showing one of six rotating words and counting up for as long as the
 * client believed a turn was running — which, with a dead server, was forever.
 * The criterion here is that a real browser, on a real server and a real app,
 * stops saying that: after the app's own socket is partitioned the dock reads
 * `unreachable`, the six action words are gone, the elapsed time is frozen at
 * the server's last `asOf`, and the composer's one stop entry is disabled with a
 * reason —
 * and that a released partition returns it to a *continued*, not restarted,
 * reading of the turn.
 *
 * Why a partition and not a killed server. Killing this run's server would trip
 * the 40s boot guard (a closed port reads as a stuck start, exit code 1) and
 * would poison every other case in the same invocation. What "no server" looks
 * like to a page is exactly "no frames and a closed socket", and `page.routeWebSocket`
 * can produce both on the app's own `/ws` — dropping server-to-page frames,
 * closing the page's socket, refusing reconnects and then releasing — without
 * touching the process. The proposal's §10.2 measured each of those four actions
 * in this repository's real e2e environment.
 *
 * Why the debug agent. There is no way to make a session read "processing" from
 * outside: `/api/providers/sessions/running` reads an in-memory registry that
 * seeding cannot reach. The debug agent's `unattended-turn` opens a real run for
 * a session with no client behind it, and its `POST /clock` walks the scenario by
 * absolute offsets while the response is still pending — so every reading below
 * is taken *while* the turn is open, which is the only moment a busy dock exists.
 * That gate is opened by `playwright.config.ts` for exactly this file's selection.
 *
 * The threshold is the server's, not this file's. `playwright.config.ts` injects
 * a shortened beat and silence budget into the *server* for this selection only,
 * and the readings below use what the server announced in its hello — the file
 * contains no `staleAfter` / `unreachableAfterMs` literal of its own.

// This is the member of the activity-dock family that has no startup guard: its two `beforeAll`
// hooks open their page with a bare navigation to the app root (an unguarded `page.goto` followed by
// `waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded')`), whose only waits are the fixture's project row and the
// case's own anchors. When this run's own Vite dependency optimizer commits a re-optimization inside
// the page's window, the in-flight module graph is interrupted, the document is replaced under the
// navigation, and the case times out on a page that never mounted — reported as a bare locator timeout
// that names neither the url nor the status. That is exactly how AC-185's ledger entry failed
// (`Timed out waiting 30000ms from config.webServer`, `done-unresolved`): the implementation landed,
// the criterion could not, because the startup cost sat inside the measured window.
//
// The trigger (this run's own dependency optimization) is decided by the cache, not by this file. What
// is inside it is the *response*: a bounded client warm-up and a bounded navigation probe, the two
// levers the sibling specs already carry (`e2e/resident-shell-tab.spec.ts`,
// `e2e/resident-running-view.spec.ts`, `e2e/resident-status-bar.spec.ts`). Neither is invented here.
//
// The guard replays a navigation and fails loudly when it cannot land; it never treats "not landed" as
// "good enough". Written the other way — probe times out, carry on — the case would wait out its own
// budget on a blank document and the run would still cross the gate's 60s, which is what this task's

 * this spec's own `beforeAll` (the bounded warm-up plus the control plane's arm/start calls) before the
 * probe's first attempt even starts. Counting replays leaves that head-room to chance; a deadline spends it.
 *
 * The deadline is the one bound the replay budget is spent out of, so it has to clear the *worst case* — a first
 * hop that spends its entire bound and whose landing probe does too — with a full replay hop and its landing probe
 * still left over. Spelled out, because this sum is the whole of why the guard can replay at all:
 *
 *   first hop        NAVIGATION_PROBE_MS      = 5_000
 * + first landing    STARTUP_PROBE_MS         = 5_000

 * so even the slowest first hop leaves a complete replay inside the deadline. That is the gap this task closes:
 * at the old deadline (12_000) an 8s first hop left 4s, the landing probe spent it, `Date.now() >= deadline` fired
 * at the throw below, and the replay never began — the guard died in the startup form on an otherwise-green tree
 * (the criterion: pass 05:20 / fail 05:22, same treeSha).
 *
 * The value is derived from *this* spec's overhead, not copied. Unlike the onboarding spec
 * (`e2e/resident-shell-tab.spec.ts`, whose three-screen wizard measured 10.2s quiet / 16.0s loaded and
 * whose deadline was fitted down to 12s for it), this spec creates its account over the API and pays only
 * the boot, the launch and the warm-up — the same overhead as the API-created siblings. 20s keeps a

/* =============================================================================================
 * AC-188 — the page's *one* activity dock, and the one answer about a session
 * =============================================================================================
 *
 * The family's other cases (AC-184, AC-185) are about what one dock says when the
 * server stops answering. This one is about there being one dock at all, and about
 * the three surfaces that used to answer "is this session working" separately —
 * the dock, the sidebar's running view (and the badge above it) and the composer's
 * send/stop button — answering it the same way, from the same source, at the same
 * instant.
 *
 * What the page looked like before. Activity was drawn on **four** unrelated
 * sources: a tab-shaped strip hanging off the composer (only from `md` up), a
 * compact line at the end of the transcript (only below `md`), the resident status
 * bar's own busy/idle word and lease counts, and the sidebar's running count —
 * the last two read from a one-second `/api/session-hosts` poll. Each pair could
 * disagree, and one pair reliably did: a turn that ends is announced to the page
 * at once and observed by the listing up to a beat later, so for that beat the
 * dock said idle while the sidebar still counted the session as running.
 *
 * What is read here, and why each reading can fail:
 *
 *   - **counts.** One `[data-activity-dock]` per viewport, and zero matches for the
 *     two markers the old surfaces published (`.chat-activity-tab`, the
 *     `chat-activity-inline` slot). A build that kept the old mount beside the new
 *     one reads 2, or reads a legacy marker — and neither is reachable by hiding
 *     anything with CSS, because both are counts of what exists.
 *   - **the resident surface.** On a resident session: zero matches for the
 *     busy/idle word and the lease counts, and non-zero readings for the address,
 *     the pid and the lifecycle controls inside the dock's expanded panel. The
 *     second half is what separates "merged into the dock" from "deleted".
 *   - **agreement.** While the turn is open, and then repeatedly across the window
 *     *after* `turn-end` — the window in which the old poll-driven sidebar lagged —
 *     the dock's state, the sidebar's running group membership and the composer's
 *     stop state are read in one sample each. No sample may show the dock idle
 *     while either of the other two says busy.
 *
 * Both viewports, each read once. The window is switched with `setViewportSize`,
 * which is the signal the app itself reads (`useDeviceSettings` watches `resize`),
 * so the same page really does re-render its narrow tier rather than a second
 * context standing in for it.
 *
 * The turn is the debug agent's, for the same reason the rest of this file uses
 * it: there is no way to make a session read "processing" from outside without a
 * real run. `unattended-turn` opens one with no client behind it and `turn-end`
 * closes it, so the moment the turn stops being real is a moment this file places
 * on the clock rather than waits for.

/* =============================================================================================
 * AC-187 — the dock's words come from the real phase of a real turn
 * =============================================================================================
 *
 * The family's other cases are about what the dock says when the *transport*
 * fails. This one is about the source of the words themselves. The dock used to
 * pick one of six rotating adjectives from a local clock — `actionWords[floor(
 * elapsedSeconds / 4) % 6]` — so the same running turn said a different thing
 * every four seconds and said nothing at all about what was actually happening.
 *
 * Here a real debug-agent turn walks a real signal sequence: it thinks, it calls
 * `Bash`, the call returns, it writes, the turn ends. The server reduces those
 * raw rows to a phase (AC-186's tracker), stamps the phase onto the activity
 * frames it already beats (AC-182's heartbeat), and the dock draws the locale's
 * word for that phase — with the tool's own name, which no clock and no lookup
 * table could produce. The shape this case pins, in one run:
 *
 *   - the phases arrive in order, thinking -> tool -> writing -> idle;
 *   - the label equals the locale's value for the phase (and names `Bash`);
 *   - six seconds inside the tool phase say the SAME thing six times; and
 *   - when the turn ends, the dock stops claiming a turn.
 *
 * The criterion is the `-g "AC-187"` selection, which runs this describe's hooks
 * (and no other describe's): the page is opened here, after this selection's own
 * warm-up.
