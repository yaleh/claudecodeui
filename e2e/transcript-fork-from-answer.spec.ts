// gap-fork-from-assistant-reply-anchor, DoD legs (1) and (2), read in a real browser.
//
// Real Chromium against the real backend + Vite client started by playwright.config.ts (isolated data dir).
// Nothing here stubs a request: the fixture session is a real Claude transcript seeded into the run's isolated
// HOME before the server booted and indexed by the backend's own synchronizer (see `seedForkAnchorTranscript` in
// playwright.config.ts), opened over the app's own routing. The fork is the SHIPPED path end to end — the button's
// own `onClick`, `ChatInterface.handleForkFromMessage`, `api.forkSession`, the route, `sessionsService.forkSessionById`
// and the Claude Agent SDK's real `forkSession` — and the branch is then read off the disk by this file, not off the
// app's rendering of it.
//
// ── Which DoD legs this covers, and which it does not. ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// (1) every turn's final reply carries the button and the user bubbles do not — asserted below.
// (2) forking at the first turn's reply lands a transcript whose last message row IS that reply and which holds
//     nothing from the second turn — asserted below, by reading the file the SDK wrote.
// (3) that a message sent inside the fork is answered with only the first turn in context — NOT here. It needs a
//     live model to answer, and this fixture is an offline transcript. Left unread rather than approximated; see
//     the task's completion record.
// (4) the button's absence while a turn is running — NOT here. It needs a live turn to be running; the same
//     absence and its positive control are read at component level in
//     src/modules/chat/tests/forkFromAssistantReply.test.tsx.
