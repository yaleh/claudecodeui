// Real Chromium against the real backend + Vite client started by playwright.config.ts (isolated data dir).
//
// The subject is the ENTER key path through the composer, read the way a user meets it: a real project from
// the run's own seeded HOME, a real session row allocated by the send the key produced, and the lifecycle
// mode read back from the server the session was addressed to. Nothing here rebuilds the mode client-side —
// `GET /api/session-hosts` is the same projection a restart uses to find a resident session whose process it
// dropped, so the `resident` this spec prints is the server's own stored preference and not the switch's
// local state. The host half is read from the same endpoint's `hosts` array, so "a resident host really
// exists for this session" is the process table's answer, not an inference from the switch.
//
// The switch POSITION is the whole of the intent. The consent gate that used to stand between the switch and
// the send — and the disclosure tick that armed it — was retired by the 2026-09-29 product change
// (`gap-resident-toggle-relocate-drop-consent-gate`), and its locale key is gone from every `chat.json`. So
// this file drives the switch and nothing else; there is no separate tick state left for it to set.
//
// The two cases are the pair the reading needs. (a) is the load-bearing one: with the switch on, Enter must
// record the resident intent through the composer's submit entry, so the server stores the session resident
// and a resident host process holds it. (b) is the positive control: with the switch off, the same key must
// send and land `per-run` — without it the `resident` reading above would have no resolution, since it would
// score the same for every session. `e2e/resident-enable-consent.spec.ts` (AC-171) presses the SEND BUTTON;
// that spec cannot see this defect, because the Enter path used to reach the send directly and skip the
// intent the switch was showing. Reading the key is this file's whole job.
