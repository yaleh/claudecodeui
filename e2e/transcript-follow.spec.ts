// taller with no new row and no store write — while a transcript the user has scrolled away from is left
// exactly where the user put it.
//
// Real Chromium against the real backend + Vite client started by playwright.config.ts (isolated data dir).
// Nothing here stubs a request: the transcript is a real Claude transcript seeded into the run's isolated
// HOME before the server booted and indexed by the backend's own synchronizer, the session is opened through
// the sidebar, and the viewport is moved in both directions by real wheel gestures.
//
// The two growths are direct DOM mutations, deliberately: no row is added and no store flush reaches the code
// under test, so only an implementation driven by the content's own geometry can see them. That is the whole
// point of the criterion — a version that waited on a React signal satisfies nothing here.
