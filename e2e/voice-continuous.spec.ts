/*
 * Continuous capture, end to end, against the real client and the real backend.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT. The composer, the hook, the segmenter, the shared VAD and the request
 * builder are the shipping code. Two things are stand-ins, and each is named where it lives:
 *
 *   · the microphone, because no CI machine has one and a real one could not be told to say an exact
 *     timeline of speech and pauses. An init script replaces `AudioContext`/`AudioWorkletNode` and
 *     `getUserMedia` with a graph the spec drives: `__voiceFake.speak(1)` feeds one second of speech
 *     with a `speechStart`, `__voiceFake.pause(2.5)` feeds silence. That is the same interface the real
 *     worklet forwards (PCM frames plus VAD events), so everything downstream of the audio thread runs
 *     unchanged.
 *
 *   · the recogniser. The settings name `dashscope-omni`, whose declaration is `proxy-only`, so the
 *     client posts to this app's `/api/voice/transcribe`; Playwright intercepts that route, so the
 *     request never leaves the machine and no credential is spent. The route answers each upload with a
 *     sentence this file chooses, and can delay or fail an individual one — which is what lets the
 *     ordering, incremental and failure readings be taken at all.
 *
 * The fixture session is seeded by `playwright.config.ts` (the server scans its projects once at boot,
 * so a transcript written during the run would never be adopted).
