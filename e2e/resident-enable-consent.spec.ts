// Real Chromium against the real backend + Vite client started by playwright.config.ts (isolated data dir).
//
// The subject is where the resident switch lives and what the disclosure in front of it is allowed to do. It
// is read the way a user meets it: a real project from the run's own seeded HOME, the real new-session screen,
// a real session row in the real sidebar, and the lifecycle mode read back from the server the send was
// addressed to. Nothing here rebuilds the mode client-side — `GET /api/session-hosts` is the same projection
// a restart uses to find a resident session whose process it dropped, so the `resident` this spec prints is
// the server's own stored preference and not the switch's local state.
//
// Two things this file is deliberately about, because they are what the redesign turns on:
//
//   * the switch is on the screen *before* the first turn (under the new-session model card) and
//     nowhere else — a session that already has a transcript draws no switch in its composer, and is
//     converted from the session menu instead;
//   * the disclosure is a read-only hint. Nothing about it may sit between the user and the switch or
//     the conversion: flipping the switch is the whole of the intent, and the send that follows is
//     resident. That is what the falsifying variant recorded in the task attacks, and the `aria-checked`
//     readings below are the assertions it reds on.
//
// There is no seam in this file: the capability matrix, the mode before and after a conversion, and the mode of
// a session nobody asked to keep running all come from the real server, and the two reads that could not be
// stated against it are called out where they would have gone.

 *

 * switch is turned on and a first message is sent, creating a brand-new session A that must land
 * resident. Then, *in the same app instance* — the sidebar navigates in-app, so `ChatInterface` is
 * not remounted and its `residentEnabled` state would still be `true` under the old code — an
 * existing per-run session B is opened and a message is sent into it. B must read back per-run.
 *
 * Under the retired shape (`if (residentIntent && targetSessionId)`, intent never cleared, and every
 * composer submit re-recording the switch position) this same send converts B, and the `per-run`
 * assertion below is where the red lands. Both readings come from `GET /api/session-hosts`.
