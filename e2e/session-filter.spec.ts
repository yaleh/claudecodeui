//
// This spec's startup path, bounded. Measured twice (runs `quay-e2e-KrUH9q`, `quay-e2e-psHPZt`): a single
// transient interruption of the app's in-flight module requests — Chromium's `net::ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED`, ten
// in one burst in the first run, the app's own five module urls failing together in the second — left the
// document with a module graph that never executed. React never mounted, the onboarding form and the project
// row never appeared, and every wait on them was unbounded: the run ended at ~55.4s / 55.6s when
// playwright.config.ts's own watchdog killed it, and the ledger read `Error: Channel closed`, which names
// neither the url nor the status. Both reds died in the startup phase; not one of the five cases ran.
//
// The trigger is outside this repository (a host-level network change notification). What is inside it is the
// *response*: the same transient interruption must cost a bounded replay, not an unbounded wait. Two levers,
// both already established in this repo's sibling specs — a bounded client warm-up taken from
// `e2e/voice-dashscope-written.spec.ts` / `e2e/transcript-follow.spec.ts`, and a bounded navigation probe
// taken from `e2e/transcript-follow.spec.ts`. Neither is invented here.
//
// What the guard may **not** do is decide anything for the five cases. It replays a navigation and it fails
// loudly when it cannot land; it never treats "not landed" as "good enough". Written the other way — probe
// times out, carry on — the five cases would each wait out their own budget on a blank document and the run
// would still cross the gate's 60s, which is what the bounded-failure reading in this task's AC measures.

 * The imports of a transformed module are already rewritten to this run's own
 * `/@fs/<cacheDir>/deps/<dep>.js?v=<hash>` urls, and that url only answers 200 once the optimizer has committed
 * the bundle: while the bundle is still being built the request is held, and a url carrying a hash from a
 * superseded run is exactly what a page receives `504 Outdated Optimize Dep` for. Vite answers a re-optimization
 * committed after it began serving by pushing `full-reload` to every connected client, which replaces the
 * document whole — the other way this criterion has lost a page mid-flight. A 200 there means the page below
 * will not race the optimizer.
 *
 * `beforeAll`, before `browser.newPage()`, is the earliest point inside the criterion's own startup path, and it
 * is strictly before any page exists — the same requests the page would have made, made first. It is here rather
 * than in playwright.config.ts's `globalSetup` because Playwright resolves every `globalSetup` entry as a
 * *script* (a path that must default-export the function), so an inline warm-up there is neither type-legal nor
 * loadable, and this task's write surface allows no new file.
 *
 * Every step is bounded, including each request: a client that accepts the connection and then never answers
 * fails here, by name, with the url and the status, rather than waiting out a timeout further up.
