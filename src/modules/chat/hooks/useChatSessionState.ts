     * The `scroll` a key raises is the one report that cannot be waited for. A
     * key moves the viewport as its *default action*, and the browser animates
     * that movement, so the report trails the press by a frame or more — and

     * the app has already seen the input. A commit landing in the window passes
     * both of the follow's gates and pins the viewport back down over the key
     * the user is holding: the offset has not moved yet, so the comparison that
     * would read the drift has nothing to read, and the intent still says
     * "following", which is only true until the report arrives.
     *
     * So an up key over the pane detaches here, in the task the input landed in.
     * The ref is written beside the state because the two are read at different
     * points in a commit and the gap between them is exactly this window: the
     * pin is judged in a layout effect, while the ref is mirrored from the state
     * by a passive effect that React runs after it, so a state-only write would
     * still leave the very commit this exists for reading the old value.
     *
     * Only an up key, and only over the pane. A key towards the bottom is the
     * user returning, and the `scroll` it raises is read as that arrival exactly
     * as before — detaching on one would strand the follow until some later
     * input undid it. And an `ArrowUp` belongs to the composer's caret, or to
     * any other control on the page, unless it was aimed at the transcript.
