/**
 * Answers the server's `ui.state_request` with what this tab is showing.
 *
 * An external MCP caller asks the server "what do the connected browsers have
 * open?"; the server broadcasts one `ui.state_request` carrying a `requestId` and
 * waits for the answers. This hook is the browser half of that round trip: on the
 * frame it reads this tab's own identifiers and ranges — which device and tab it
 * is, which panel/project/session it shows, which message ids are on screen, how
 * many approvals and queued messages are waiting — and sends one
 * `ui.state_response` back with the request's id echoed verbatim.
 *
 * ## Identifiers and ranges only
 *
 * The report deliberately carries no message body, no user selection and no panel
 * content. The server projects an answer down to exactly those fields before an
 * MCP caller ever sees it, and a caller that wants the text behind a message id
 * asks `session_read` for it. Reading the DOM here rather than threading a dozen
 * live values through the provider is also what keeps this hook mountable where
 * the state actually lives — see the mount point in `ChatInterface`.
 *
 * ## The page is read, never driven
 *
 * A request asks a question; it does not navigate, focus or un-hide anything. The
 * four DOM/`document` readings below are point-in-time facts about the page as it
 * already is. A tab that is not running this hook simply never answers, and the
 * server reports it `unresponsive` — that is the designed outcome, not a failure.
