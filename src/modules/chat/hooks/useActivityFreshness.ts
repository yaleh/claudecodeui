/**
 * The browser's liveness reading for one session's activity dock.
 *
 * This is the wiring AC-183 deliberately left out: it feeds the pure freshness
 * machine from the app's own socket — the `chat_subscribed` hello and the
 * `activity.heartbeat` beat — so the dock has an authoritative "is the server
 * still there" reading instead of a local table nothing on a dead server can
 * clear.
 *
 * The mapping is deliberately conservative. Only the two gateway frames that
 * carry the activity contract count as evidence; provider messages do not,
 * because a replayed message's `timestamp` is when it was produced, not when
 * the server last spoke, and folding it in would move the elapsed anchor
 * backwards. Both gateway frames carry a turn reading, and both are folded in:
 * the hello states `isProcessing`, and a beat states the run registry's own
 * in-flight bit *and* the reduced `phase`. The in-flight bit is the authority —
 * it is what distinguishes a turn that ended from a turn the phase tracker has
 * simply never seen a frame for (its `idle` covers both) — and a beat that
 * reports it false is the frame that ends a turn a hello pinned. A beat that
 * omits the bit (a server predating the field) falls back to the phase, whose
 * `idle` was the only ending signal before the authority existed, and a beat
 * that carries neither says nothing about the turn and only advances the clock.
 * The silence threshold is the one the server announced
 * (`unreachableAfterMs`) — never a client constant.
 *
 * Used by chat's `ActivityIndicator` and `ChatComposer`; the decision it feeds
 * is `deriveActivityDockView`, and its criterion is
 * `src/modules/chat/tests/activityDockUnreachable.test.tsx`.
