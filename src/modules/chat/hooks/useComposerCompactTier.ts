 * reading where the two control groups stop sharing a row: at 742px they landed on separate rows
 * (tops 36px apart, box 113px tall) and at 757px they shared one (4px apart, 77px), so the crossing
 * is in (742, 757]. 800 puts the widths that still fit inside that band on the compact side as
 * well: 58px above the widest box that wrapped, 43px above the narrowest that fit, and 66px below
 * the 866px the box is capped at — which is the box a 1280px window gives, where the desktop
 * arrangement is unchanged.

 * budget at 844x330 was a 57px header, a 147px composer and 126px left for the transcript — while
 * width is abundant: the same viewport hands the composer a 763px box, and the six controls the
 * compact row carries measure 254px of it including their gaps. Stacking them costs the transcript
 * a whole row (57px, ~17% of the screen) to buy nothing, so on this tier they move up beside the
 * input and the row's height becomes the textarea's own.
 *
 * 480 is the floor rather than the target: it leaves 254px of controls and a still-usable ~200px of
 * input inside it. Below that — the sidebar open on the same landscape phone, where the box falls to
 * roughly 500px and can go narrower still — the stacked arrangement is kept, because a squeezed
 * input is worse than a squeezed transcript for the user who opened the panel on purpose.
