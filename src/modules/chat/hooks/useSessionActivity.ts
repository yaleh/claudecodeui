/**
 * The client's per-session background-work store: the task table and schedule
 * table a session's activity snapshot carries, and the hooks that read them.
 *
 * Why a store rather than component state. The two readings this module serves —
 * the dock's summary (`ActivityIndicator`) and a transcript card's live state
 * (`SubagentPanel` / `BashCommandDisplay`) — live in unrelated parts of the tree,
 * and both must react to the *same* frame. A store keyed by session id, written
 * once by the realtime handler and read through `useSyncExternalStore`, is what
 * makes the frame the one source: neither reader derives a state of its own.
 *
 * Where the data comes from. The server pushes a whole snapshot on
 * `activity.snapshot` (to a joiner, before any change) and again on every
 * `activity.upsert` (one revision per change). Both are the same shape, so a
 * frame *replaces* the session's view rather than patching it — a missed frame is
 * harmless because the next one carries everything. Nothing here polls
 * `/api/session-hosts`: the background panel is drawn from these frames, which is
 * the whole difference AC-194 pins.
 *
 * The task-by-tool-use-id lookup is deliberately cross-session: a `tool_use` id
 * is globally unique, and a transcript card knows only the id on its own row, so
 * scanning the held sessions is how a card joins its task without threading a
 * session id down through the transcript renderer.
