/**
 * Continuous voice capture: one press, one stream, and as many uploads as the speech needs.
 *
 * THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH. A short dictation and a long one are the same code: the microphone's PCM
 * is segmented as it arrives, every segment is transcribed on its own, and the answers are committed
 * in the order they were spoken. A press whose speech is followed by five seconds of silence reaches
 * the recogniser on that silence — the segmenter's flush — so the box fills while the microphone is
 * still open; anything still buffered when the press ends is flushed by the stop, which is the shape
 * the old press-to-talk path always had. While a request from a still-recording listen is outstanding
 * the hook reports `inFlight`, which the composer paints as the mic button's pulsing dot.
 *
 * WHAT THE USER SEES WHILE TALKING. Text appears as each segment settles, but only the *contiguous
 * prefix*: if the second segment's answer arrives before the first's, nothing is committed until the
 * first lands, and then both do, in order. A segment whose retries are exhausted contributes no text
 * at all — the failure is reported in the composer's own red notice, and the segments after it are
 * still committed, so one lost segment costs a phrase rather than the rest of the dictation.
 *
 * WHERE THE TEXT GOES. The hook hands the composer the committed text *so far* on every commit
 * (`onTranscript(full, false)`) and, when the stop was a send, once more with the whole text and
 * `send=true`. The composer owns where that text sits: it tracks the insertion range that opened at
 * the caret when listening began (see `voiceInsertion.ts`), so edits the user makes elsewhere while
 * talking are preserved and the committed words stay contiguous.
 *
 * The clip slot it fills on stop is the replay pair: the filtered audio the segments were cut from,
 * and — when the stream was short enough to keep — the raw PCM the microphone produced.
