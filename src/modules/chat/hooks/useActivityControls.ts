/**
 * The client's control half of the activity dock: the two requests a person can
 * place against the work a session is holding — stop a background task, and move
 * a running foreground tool to the background.
 *
 * The controls hold no state. A click sends exactly one frame over the app's own
 * socket and changes nothing locally:
 *
 *  - `chat.stop-task` `{ sessionId, taskId, requestId }`
 *  - `chat.background-task` `{ sessionId, toolUseId, requestId }`
 *
 * A row's state, and whether a backgrounded task has appeared at all, come back
 * only through the server's own `activity.snapshot` / `activity.upsert` frames
 * (reduced into `useSessionActivity`). That is what makes "the click is not
 * optimistic" a reading a criterion can take: this module imports no store
 * writer, so there is no local path by which a click could move a row.
 *
 * Whether a control can be used has **two** readings, and both are needed:
 *
 *  - *liveness* (`useActivityFreshness`): when the dock has gone `unreachable`,
 *    no request can be placed at all, and both controls are disabled with the
 *    composer stop's own `claudeStatus.unreachable.stopReason`;
 *  - *capability*: the provider's own statement about the verb, read from
 *    `GET /api/providers/capabilities` for the session's provider. A resident
 *    session whose provider declares no such verb gets a control that is
 *    disabled **and says why**, rather than one that looks live, takes the
 *    click, and quietly does nothing — the shape this gate exists to remove.
 *
 * The capability applies to a *resident* session only, and that is the matrix's
 * own rule rather than a client-side one: `residentFeatures` describes what a
 * held process can do. A per-run turn is placed through the runtime's own
 * verb, which is a different route the matrix says nothing about, so a per-run
 * session keeps its control enabled however the resident declaration reads.
 * {@link readSessionHostState} is where the session's provider and lifecycle
 * mode come from — the two facts the server's own gate reads — so the control
 * that will not be clicked and the request that would be refused cannot
 * disagree.
 *
 * The pending foreground tool is read off the loaded transcript, never derived
 * here: the server's Turn Tracker is authoritative for "which tool_use is
 * unpaired", and the transcript is where its id is on screen. {@link
 * findPendingForegroundTool} is the one place that reading is taken, so the
 * panel and any other reader agree.
