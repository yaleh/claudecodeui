/**
 * The row a turn is streamed into has to keep one identity for the whole turn.
 *
 * The transcript keys each row by the store id it carries
 * (`getIntrinsicMessageKey`), so an id that changes under a row is an unmount
 * followed by a mount. On the frame the turn settles on that remount lands on a
 * transcript pinned to the bottom, where the freshly inserted row is measured at
 * its `content-visibility` intrinsic height — the pane's content collapses, the
 * browser clamps the offset, and the reader sees the transcript jump. The id is
 * therefore asserted here rather than left to the browser's geometry.
 *
 * Two things in the store change a row's identity under it, and both are
 * exercised below: the finalize that settles the streaming row, and the server's
 * persisted echo of the same reply — which arrives twice, once as a realtime
 * frame and once in the refresh the terminal `complete` triggers, and which the
 * reconciliation would otherwise let replace the client's row.
