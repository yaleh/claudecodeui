/**
 * The sidebar search jump used to render the whole transcript and then scan the
 * DOM for the snippet. With nothing to identify the hit ahead of time, a miss
 * was indistinguishable from a hit: it scrolled somewhere plausible and flashed
 * the highlight, telling the user they had been taken to their result when they
 * had not.
 *
 * Resolving the index from the message data first is what makes a miss
 * detectable — findSearchTargetIndex returns -1 and the jump declines rather
 * than pretending. The DOM step still ends in a nearest-timestamp match on its
 * final retry (useChatSessionState's findRenderedMessageElement with
 * allowNearest), but only for a target it has already resolved: a hit collapsed
 * inside a tool group is rendered under the group's own first timestamp.
