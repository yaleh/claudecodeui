/**
 * When a segment stays on the device, and when it leaves — and how the user is told.
 *
 * WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `routeClientAsrSegment` is the whole policy: it asks the `sensevoice-wasm`
 * adapter for one clip and then decides whether to keep the answer or hand the segment to the server.
 * The probe's readings (`docs/experiments/2026-10-06-voice-client-asr-probe.md` §0.7, §现场) are why the
 * policy has exactly two exits — a device that cannot run the model at all, and one segment whose
 * realtime factor came out over 1.0 — and both are cases below.
 *
 * WHY THE PER-SEGMENT CASE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. The probe measured both real devices dropping to
 * four-to-nine times real time on consecutive segments (a screen off, a background tab) while their
 * AVERAGE stayed around 0.30 and 0.45. A policy that judged the average would keep every one of those
 * clips on a device that had stopped keeping up, and the queue would never drain. So the slow case
 * below runs three segments through the same engine: two comfortably under real time and one over it,
 * and asserts that the two stayed and the one left. An average-based policy cannot pass that case.
 *
 * THE NEGATIVE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT OF THE REST. A routing test that only showed "this one falls
 * back" would stay green for a policy that fell back on everything, so the same file also pins the
 * three readings that must NOT leave the device: a fast success, a client-side refusal
 * (`NO_SPEECH_DETECTED` — an answer about this clip, not a broken engine), and a container the engine
 * rejects. Each of those asserts zero events, which is the same assertion as "the audio did not go
 * anywhere".
 *
 * THE ENGINE IS A FAKE, AND THAT IS THE HONEST SHAPE. A real onnxruntime-web session needs a 239 MB
 * checkpoint, WASM SIMD and a worker; none of those is what this file is about, and the seam exists
 * precisely so the policy can be judged without them. What is real is everything the policy reads: the
 * registered adapter, the capability declaration it guards with, the error vocabulary, and the
 * `window` event.
