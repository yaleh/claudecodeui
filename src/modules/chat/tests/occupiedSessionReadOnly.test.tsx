/**
 * A conversation a Claude Code background job is running is read-only — and it comes back by itself.
 *
 * THE CLAIM, IN ONE SENTENCE. When `GET /api/session-hosts` says a session is held
 * (`occupiedBy: { jobId, pid }`), the composer refuses to send — its input is disabled, a notice names the
 * holder and the command that frees it, the status bar offers no [Start], and the send path itself refuses
 * even when it is called directly. When the holder goes away, the very next poll puts all of that back,
 * in the same mounted tree, with no reload.
 *
 * WHY A REFUSAL AND NOT A HINT. The CLI exits 1 on a `--resume` of a session a bg job holds and says so
 * only on stderr, which this app drops — so before this, the user typed a message and got
 * `Resident process exited (error)` back. A disabled textarea alone would not be a state: a form can be
 * submitted from a script, a stale handler, or a queued voice transcript. The send entry is therefore
 * asserted directly, in the two arms that need each other — refused while held, and *sent* once released.
 * Without the second arm the first one would also pass against a composer that never sends anything.
 *
 * THE STORE IS THE REAL ONE. Unlike its siblings in this directory, this file does NOT mock
 * `@/shared/hooks/useSessionHosts`. The whole second half of the AC is about the poll — "no reload, no
 * remount, the next tick restores" — and a mocked snapshot source would make that half unmeasurable:
 * the test would be swapping a fixture variable, not watching a poller pick up a new answer. So the real
 * module-level store is driven through a stubbed global `fetch` that answers `/api/session-hosts` from a
 * listing this file mutates, and the fake timer queue is advanced by exactly one poll interval to make
 * the release arrive the way it arrives in the browser. Every request the store makes is counted, so
 * "the poll really ran" is read rather than assumed.
 *
 * WHAT IS COMPOSED HERE, AND WHAT IS NOT. `ChatInterface` is not rendered: it wants websocket, session
 * protection and task-settings providers, and none of them is part of this claim. The harness below wires
 * the same two components `ChatInterface` wires — the real `ChatComposer` and the real `ResidentStatusBar`,
 * both reading the real store — from the real `useChatComposerState`, and renders one real
 * `MessageComponent` row as the transcript that must survive the state. Every reading in the AC is taken
 * off a shipped component; only the wiring is this file's.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM. That the server computes `occupiedBy` correctly — that is
 * `server/modules/session-hosts/tests/session-hosts-routes.test.ts` and
 * `server/modules/providers/tests/claude-session-occupancy.test.ts`. Here the listing is given to the
 * frontend, never derived by it.
 *
