/**
 * On a phone the composer's footer wrapped onto a second row, because it carried
 * seven controls including the commands, schedule and token ones. The fix keeps the
 * primary row to the six controls that send a message and moves the other three
 * behind a single "more" entry on the narrow layout — while the wide layout keeps
 * showing them inline, unchanged.
 *
 * jsdom parses no Tailwind, so nothing here can read a `flex-nowrap` class or a
 * breakpoint. What it can hold is the *structure* the CSS then lays out: which
 * controls exist in which tier at all. The tier is switched by the signal the
 * component itself reads — `window.innerWidth` against the `md` boundary — so a
 * component that switched on some other signal would take the same branch here and
 * these cases would fail rather than pass against a second copy of the rule. That
 * the real box really measures `scrollWidth === clientWidth` on a phone is the e2e
 * probe's job, not a unit test's.
 *
 * The last two cases read the running turn instead of the footer, over a composer
 * and a message pane rendered together — the two surfaces the turn can be drawn on,
 * as ChatInterface renders them. What they can hold is which surface exists at
 * which tier and how many accessible stop entries the pair offers: below `md` the
 * status is a line in the transcript carrying no control, so the composer's own
 * submit button is the one entry; from `md` up the tab still carries its own, and
 * the reading is unchanged. That the line really sits under the last message and
 * really scrolls with it is likewise the browser probe's job.
