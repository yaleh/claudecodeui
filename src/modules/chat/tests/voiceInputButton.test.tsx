/**
 * The in-flight dot on the microphone button.
 *
 * The composer shows that a transcription request is out with a small pulsing dot inside the mic
 * button — no new control, no copy. These readings are the two things that makes true and the one
 * that makes it accessible: the dot exists exactly when `inFlight` is set, and the pulse is gated
 * behind `motion-safe:` so a reader with reduced motion gets a still dot.
 *
 * The class assertion is deliberate and load-bearing: the `motion-safe:` prefix is a real
 * requirement (a constant animation is the thing the accessibility rule forbids), and a rendered
 * element's class list is the only place it can be read without a real browser's media query.
