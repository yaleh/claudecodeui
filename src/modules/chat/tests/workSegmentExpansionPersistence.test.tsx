/**
 * AC-204: a work segment's expansion state lives in the pane's own React state —
 * longer-lived than the `LazyMessageRow` subtree it is drawn inside, shorter-lived
 * than a pane mount.
 *
 * The two readings are each other's controls, and each has a false form the other
 * rules out:
 *
 *   (i)  expand a segment, drive its row out of the viewport and back — the row is
 *        really unmounted (its members leave the DOM, its placeholder stays), and
 *        the segment is still open when it returns. State kept *inside* the record
 *        would fail here: the record dies with the row.
 *   (ii) expand a segment, unmount the whole pane, mount a fresh one — the segment
 *        is collapsed. State kept at module scope would fail here: the fresh pane
 *        would inherit the previous mount's expansion.
 *
 * Everything below drives the shipped pane, selector and record; nothing here
 * re-implements a second copy of them. The intersection observer is the drivable
 * stand-in `lazyMessageRow.test.tsx` installs, because jsdom has none and the
 * unmount-under-test is the real `LazyMessageRow` near/far state machine.
