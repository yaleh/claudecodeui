/**
 * The client half of the raw (pre-VAD) corpus: when a listen uploads its raw audio, whether the
 * deployment's switch gates it, and that the upload never holds up the text.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS THE CRITERION FOR. `voice-capture-raw*.test.ts` (server) own the endpoint and the
 * file. This one owns the browser's decision to use it: the switch read from `GET /api/voice/capture`
 * gates every upload (`isVoiceRawCaptureEnabled`), the raw upload carries the SAME `listenId` as the
 * listen's `/transcribe` requests, and — the property that matters most — the corpus upload is fired
 * AFTER the text and NEVER awaited, so a raw endpoint that hangs cannot delay a single word.
 *
 * THE TWO FALSE FORMS THIS FILE IS BUILT TO CATCH:
 *   · "the switch is ignored" — the off case would then call `captureRawVoice`, and the zero below
 *     would not be a zero.
 *   · "the raw upload is awaited before the submit" — the never-resolving double in the blocking case
 *     would then stop the send from ever happening. The test stops with `send: true` and requires the
 *     send to arrive anyway, so an awaited implementation reds it by construction rather than by a
 *     text mutation (a hook mutation harness would have to copy the hook's whole import graph).
