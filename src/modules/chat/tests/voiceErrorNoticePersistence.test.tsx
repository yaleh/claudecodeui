/**
 * The executable half of the browser criterion's three falsifications.
 *
 * `e2e/voice-error-messages.spec.ts` reads the shipping notice in a real browser: the sentence a
 * refusal gets, that it is still there four seconds later, that it goes away when it is closed, that
 * the draft survives, and that the page carries no concatenated transport sentence. Those readings
 * are only worth what they are worth if the implementations they are meant to reject would have
 * turned them red — and four browser runs (a baseline plus three mutants) do not fit in that
 * criterion's budget: one run costs ~24s against a 55s watchdog, so the mutants are taken here,
 * against the same shipped component, in jsdom, and the browser-level rig is deliberately NOT built.
 *
 * THE LEVER IS A PATCHED COPY OF THE SHIPPED FILE, imported from a temporary path in the source tree
 * and deleted when this file finishes. Three other levers were considered and rejected:
 *
 *   · A module double (`vi.mock('.../ChatComposer', factory)`) would have to *re-implement* the
 *     component to carry the mutation — the double is what would be read, not the shipped file.
 *   · Patching the module in place would leave the tree mutated if this file ever crashed mid-run,
 *     which is the one outcome that must not be possible.
 *   · An in-memory clone cannot be imported as a module without a data: URL, and a `.tsx` source is
 *     not transformed through one — the mutant would not be the shipped source under a JSX parser.
 *
 * What is left is the one the task's proposal names: a copy in the same tree, patched by an exact
 * string replacement, imported, read, and removed. Each mutation is therefore the SHIPPED source
 * plus one anchored edit and nothing else, and the copy is written and removed inside the case that
 * reads it, so `git status --porcelain` is the same before and after this file runs.
 *
 * Every case follows the same three steps, in this order: the unmutated copy is green first (so the
 * reading is known to be about the mutation rather than about the harness), the mutant turns exactly
 * one predicted reading red and prints which one, and a reading OUTSIDE that family stays green (so
 * "turned red" is not satisfied by a component that stopped rendering anything at all).
