/**
 * AC-205: a work segment's anchor is its FIRST member's intrinsic key, and
 * nothing the streaming tail does may re-mint it.
 *
 * The anchor is the same key the transcript binds a segment's identity to
 * (AC-202's `groupWorkSegments` mints `segment.key` from
 * `getIntrinsicMessageKey(firstMember)`, and AC-204's panel addresses a segment
 * by exactly that key with `data-work-segment-key`), so the readings below
 * consume the shipped identity rather than a second copy computed in the test.
 * The expanded set — `expandedAnchors`, the same shape as the panel's
 * `expandedSegmentKeys` — is keyed by that anchor, which is what makes a stable
 * anchor equivalent to a stable expansion.
 *
 * Two growth directions are pinned as documented behaviour rather than as
 * defects (GOAL-016 §"已知不等价点与限制"):
 *
 *   (a) head growth — an older page prepended to a window whose top was the
 *       first thing loaded. The prepended rows join the top run, so the run's
 *       first member changes and its anchor (and expansion) is lost. Driven
 *       through the shipped `mergeOlderServerPage`.
 *
 *   (b) a folded terminator echo — the client's realtime copy of a reply the
 *       server already holds in the same turn sits between two runs. The
 *       store's assistant-echo reconciliation prunes that realtime copy, the
 *       two runs become adjacent, and the second run's anchor (and expansion)
 *       is lost. Driven through `useSessionStore`'s public methods, never a
 *       dedup re-implemented here.
 *
 * Both boundaries are asserted as "it really is dropped" — the old anchor is
 * gone from the current anchor set — each with a local positive control (a
 * segment the fold does not touch keeps its anchor and stays expanded), so a
 * constant "everything is lost" assertion cannot stand in for the reading.
