/**
 * The composer's footer was arranged by the window width alone, and a window 768px wide with the
 * sidebar open leaves the input box 445px — narrow enough that one recording's replay pair pushed
 * the two control groups onto separate rows (the browser probe read the groups' tops 36px apart,
 * and 72px apart with a pair). The window was never the wrong number to ask about the *device*;
 * it is the wrong number to ask about the *box*, which the sidebar, its drag, and the chat
 * column's own cap all resize while the window stands still.
 *
 * So the tier now reads two signals — the window's `md` rule, and the box's own measured width —
 * and these cases are about the second one. jsdom lays nothing out, so the box's width is not
 * something a render can produce: it is *given* here, by a getter over the form's `clientWidth`
 * (the number the hook reads) that the cases can move, and a `ResizeObserver` double that drives
 * the re-measure the way a real one drives it after a sidebar drag. Every case therefore reads one
 * thing: which signal the composer's footer is arranged by, and which controls that arrangement
 * puts in it.
 *
 * What jsdom still cannot answer — whether the box really fits its row — is the browser probe's
 * job, and the threshold it produced is the number the cells below straddle.
