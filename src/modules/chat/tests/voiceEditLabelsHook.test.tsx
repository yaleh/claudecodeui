/**
 * The send hook: the moment a listen's words and the user's own edit are both known.
 *
 * `voiceEditLabels.test.ts` owns what a label MEANS — the ops, the shape rule, the boundary between
 * a correction and a rewrite. What it cannot see is whether the app ever derives one: a pure module
 * that nothing calls is a module that labels nothing, and the reading that matters here is the join
 * — the send handler asking for labels for the text it is about to send, and putting them back
 * beside the audio they came from. This file drives the real `ChatComposer` through a real mic press
 * and a real submit; the only stand-ins are the speech endpoint (there is no offline recogniser in
 * this checkout) and the label write itself (the store is the server's business, read by
 * `server/modules/voice/tests/voice-data.test.ts`).
 *
 * THE READINGS ARE A SET, and each one is stated against the failure that would make it vacuous.
 * "A PATCH happens" alone would pass on a write that ran even when the message never went out; "the
 * message still goes out" alone would pass on a hook that does nothing at all. The switch-off case
 * is taken with a record id ALREADY IN HAND, so it reads the gate rather than the absence of a
 * record — turned off for the whole press instead, there would be nothing to PATCH whether or not
 * the gate existed, and the case would pass for the wrong reason.
 *
 * The failure arm is TWO CASES rather than one, because the two shapes fail at different moments
 * and only the second is falsifiable on its own. A rejection settles in a microtask, long after the
 * message has gone, so a hook with no catch at all still passes it; a transport that throws on the
 * way to building the request throws INSIDE the submit handler, ahead of `onSubmit`, and takes the
 * message with it unless the hook catches synchronously. Every case here was checked against a
 * mutation of the shipped hook that reddens it and nothing else.
