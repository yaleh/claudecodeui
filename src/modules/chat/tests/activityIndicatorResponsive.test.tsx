/**
 * The running turn's status is one surface at every viewport.
 *
 * From `md` up it used to be a tab-shaped strip the composer hung off the input's
 * top edge — floating, and therefore over the transcript, which is why the pane
 * reserved space for it — and below `md` a compact line at the end of the list.
 * Those were two mount sites for one component, and the pair could disagree. They
 * are one surface now: an in-flow status line at the end of the message flow, at
 * every width and height, carrying no control of its own. The composer's submit
 * button is the one stop entry on every tier.
 *
 * jsdom parses no Tailwind and lays nothing out, so what these cases read is what
 * the DOM can answer: which surface exists at which width, what it contains,
 * where the inline line sits in the document, and which classes the pane's
 * padding is built from. The tier is switched by the signal the components
 * themselves read — `window.innerWidth` against the `md` boundary — so an
 * implementation that switched on some other signal would take the same branch
 * here and these cases would pass against a second copy of the rule. That the real
 * box really scrolls with its messages, really does not overlap the last one, and
 * really exposes one Stop is the browser probe's job, not a unit test's.
