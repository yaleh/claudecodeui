/**
 * AC-207 (gap-ac207-expand-all-first-segment-recollapse): the fleet red is a document
 * reload, not a re-keyed anchor — the two halves of the chain the task's proposal
 * named, read separately, both through shipped code.
 *
 * The proposal named this chain: "a segment's first member is re-minted on settle, the
 * anchor key (the segment's identity, == `getIntrinsicMessageKey(firstMember)`) moves,
 * and the pane's expanded set — keyed by that anchor — no longer contains it, so the
 * run collapses while the runs whose keys did not move stay open." It asked for a
 * deterministic reading of it. Two readings answer, and each is the other's boundary:
 *
 *   (1) the anchor is only as stable as its first member's fields. For a segment whose
 *       first member carries no stable identity, `getIntrinsicMessageKey` falls through
 *       to a timestamp + content preview, so re-minting either moves the anchor and the
 *       expansion keyed by the old one is orphaned. The construction below drives the
 *       shipped projection (`normalizedToChatMessages`) and the shipped selector, and
 *       pins both the stable direction (a same-fields re-projection keeps the anchor)
 *       and the moving one (a re-minted timestamp moves it). Whether the shipped sync
 *       path ever applies that re-mint to a segment's FIRST member is read in the task's
 *       Evidence, not asserted here.
 *
 *   (2) the red's real shape is a pane remount. The client's own Vite build replaces the
 *       document whole on a re-optimization (`504 Outdated Optimize Dep`, the failure the
 *       sibling criteria settle with bounded reloads), which mounts a fresh pane; AC-204's
 *       contract starts a fresh pane collapsed. So a reload landing between opening the
 *       runs strands the runs opened before it and leaves the runs opened after it open —
 *       the "20 rows, first run collapsed" the recorded trace shows. The fixture here is
 *       the e2e seed's three-run shape, so the reading is the observed failure reproduced
 *       deterministically rather than a restatement of AC-204's single-run cases.
