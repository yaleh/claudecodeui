 * `projectIdentifiers.test.ts` owns where the candidate names come from and
 * `identifierRepair.test.ts` owns what the repair does with them. What neither can
 * see is the join: the composer fetching a project's files, the hook repairing the
 * recogniser's text against them, and the repaired text being what the composer is
 * handed. That join is what this file drives, end to end, through the real
 * `ChatComposer` — the only stand-in is the speech endpoint, because there is no
 * offline recogniser in this checkout.
 *
 * The two readings are deliberately paired. "A repair happens" alone would pass on a
 * chain that repairs everything, and "plain prose is untouched" alone would pass on a
 * chain that does nothing at all — which is exactly the state this task is changing.
 * Only both together pin the behaviour: one rewrite, and no rewrite where none is due.
