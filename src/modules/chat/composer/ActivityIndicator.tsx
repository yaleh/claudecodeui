 * The activity dock: one honest reading of what a session is doing.
 *
 * It is the surface that replaced the rotating `Thinking…` label, and — since
 * the consolidation — the *only* one. The desktop tab-shaped strip and the
 * transcript's compact line used to be two renderings of one component behind a
 * `variant` switch, each with a marker of its own; they are now a single surface
 * with a single `[data-activity-dock]` root, mounted once per viewport, so a
 * reader that counts docks counts one and a reader that looks for the old
 * markers finds none.
 *
 * Every viewport draws it the same way now: an in-flow status line at the end of
 * the message list, with no interrupt affordance of its own. The tab that hung
 * off the composer's top edge from `md` up used to carry its own Stop and its own
 * Esc hint; both are gone, and the composer's submit button is the one stop
 * entry at every width and height. This surface only reports.
 *
 * Two things decide what it says — the client's local "this session is
 * processing" table, and the freshness of the server's own frames (via
 * `useActivityFreshness`). When the server stops proving it is there, the dock
 * stops speaking for it: the state becomes `unreachable`, the elapsed reading
 * freezes at the server's last `asOf`, and the label says the connection is
 * lost. The six rotating action words never appear in that state, in any locale.
 *
 * The dock answers one question — what is this session doing — and nothing else.
 * A resident session's own facts (the address of the process, its pid, and the
 * controls that start, restart and close it) used to live in an expanded panel
 * here, behind an arrow, which meant the dock had to stay on screen between turns
 * to carry the arrow, and that a panel opened in the message flow pushed the
 * transcript instead of floating over it. They are the resident pill's now, in
 * the header (`ResidentSessionBadge`); the dock is absent between turns for every
 * session, resident or not.
 *
 * Records `data-activity-dock` / `data-activity-state` / `data-activity-phase`
 * (and the server-derived `data-activity-elapsed-ms`) for the browser criterion.
 * The phase and the running label are the same reading: both come from the phase
 * the server reduced, so a reader that checks either one is checking that source
 * rather than two independent claims.
