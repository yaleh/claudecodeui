 * out of this task's write surface. What is left is the shape the sibling fold in
 * `PermissionRequestsBanner` already ships — a literal on a `<summary>` — and the fact that this one
 * is only ever announced, never rendered: it is an attribute, so it cannot reach the bubble's text.

/**
 * The notice a failed recognition leaves on screen, and the fold that carries its machine-readable half.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT RENDERED INSIDE THE BUTTON. The mic button lives in the composer's footer, and the
 * composer's form is `relative overflow-hidden` (`PromptInput`'s own shell, so that the textarea's
 * highlight layer can be clipped to its rounded corners). A notice anchored to the button and drawn
 * above it therefore grows out of the form's box and is CLIPPED: the visible part is the slice inside
 * the form, and the close control — the notice's top row — sits outside it, where the chat pane is the
 * element that actually receives a pointer. The app already draws its other floating layer this way:
 * `ChatComposer` puts the activity indicator in `chat-composer-shell`, a sibling of the form, for the
 * same reason. This component is rendered from there, so its `bottom-full` is the shell's top edge.
 *
 * It renders a REPORT rather than a sentence: which sentence a refusal gets is the user's language's
 * answer, so it is resolved here, at render, through the same translator the rest of the composer
 * uses. The machine-readable half (the status, the code strings) is folded away rather than shown — it
 * is what a reader matches against a log, not what a user needs in order to act, and the notice must
 * not read as the transport's own vocabulary.
