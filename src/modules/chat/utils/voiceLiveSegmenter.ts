/**
 * The continuous-capture segmenter: the missing link between the streaming VAD's frame-by-frame
 * decisions and the segment pipeline's upload jobs.
 *
 * `voiceEndpoint.ts`'s `StreamingVad` answers "was this 20 ms frame speech?" and, from that,
 * where a sentence ends. `voiceSegments.ts`'s pipeline answers "what happens to a segment once it
 * is a job?" — ordinals, retries, reassembly. What neither owns is the step between them: turning
 * a live PCM stream into the *segments themselves*. That is this module, and it owns exactly five
 * rules, each of which is a decision rather than a detection one:
 *
 *   · FLUSH ON SILENCE (`DEFAULT_FLUSH_SILENCE_SEC`, 5 s). Once the buffered speech has been
 *     followed by this much continuous silence, it is emitted *however short it is*. This is the
 *     latency rule: without it a lone short utterance waits inside the buffer until the user
 *     presses stop, because the min-length floor below would otherwise step over every pause.
 *     The emitted segment does not carry the wait — it ends at the last speech frame, with only
 *     the usual trailing keep-gap. The wait after a segment is a property from a *real unit price*
 *     re-read (input ¥0.8 / output ¥2.7 per million tokens): a 15 s request costs ¥0.001–0.006, so
 *     a minute of speech cut into many requests is a fraction of a yuan a day. The recogniser's
 *     own latency (15–22 s on `dashscope-omni`) dwarfs the extra 5 s, so cost is not the reason to
 *     wait and latency is the reason not to.
 *
 *   · MIN LENGTH (`DEFAULT_MIN_SEGMENT_SEC`, 20 s). A segment is not worth cutting at a *pause*
 *     until enough of it is speech. The original 30 s came from the same fixed-overhead cost model;
 *     the re-read above is why it drops to 20. While the buffered *speech* is under the floor, a
 *     pause does not end the segment: it is stepped over and kept (compressed, below). The silence
 *     flush above is the release valve for everything the floor would otherwise hold.
 *
 *   · CUT ON A PAUSE (`DEFAULT_CUT_PAUSE_SEC`, 2.0 s). Once the floor is reached, the segment ends
 *     at the first pause at least this long. A pause is the safest place a cut can land — no word
 *     is on it — so a pause cut carries no overlap.
 *
 *   · THE CEILING (`DEFAULT_MAX_SEGMENT_SEC`, 60 s). A run that reaches this much *emitted* audio
 *     with no long pause is force-cut at its quietest recent frame. A 60 s 16 kHz mono WAV is
 *     about 1.9 MB, comfortably inside `dashscope-omni`'s 10 MB whole-request budget. A forced
 *     cut lands inside speech by definition, so the next segment is pulled back across it by
 *     `OVERLAP_SEC` — the word on the cut appears in both halves for the text layer to dedupe.
 *
 *   · THE GAP FILTER (`DEFAULT_KEEP_GAP_SEC`, 1.0 s). A pause the min-length rule stepped over is
 *     silence the recogniser does not need in full. Gaps at or under the filter are kept
 *     sample-exact — a short pause is a punctuation cue (`pauseCues`), not waste — and only the
 *     excess of a *long* gap is dropped, down to the filter's length.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DRIVEN BY EVENTS AND NOT A SECOND DETECTOR. The frames' speech/silence decision is
 * the streaming VAD's, and a second copy of it here would be the drift the shared module exists
 * to prevent. So the segmenter is handed the audio (`push`) and the VAD's events, and it reads
 * boundaries straight off the events' sample offsets. The worklet that produces both is
 * `src/modules/chat/audio/voiceFrameProcessor.ts`.
 *
 * IT IS A PURE MODULE, AND IT IMPORTS ONLY THROUGH THE `@/` ALIAS. No DOM, no React, no clock,
 * no network: `push` is a function of the audio and the events. The `@/` alias (not a relative
 * path) is also what lets the offline truth harness load it unchanged — `experiments/voice-vad/
 * run.mjs` registers the same alias — so the module a browser runs is the module the T1 reading
 * is taken on.

 * stepped over rather than cut on, so a short burst stays in the buffer waiting for either more
 * speech or the silence flush. It is a cost floor, not a latency one: the fixed ~407-token prompt
 * per request is why a segment is not cut at every breath. The original 30 s came from that model;
 * a re-read against the real unit price (input ¥0.8 / output ¥2.7 per million tokens) shows the

 * its own breaths and the input no longer reads as a ceiling test at all. 2.0 s is the shortest
