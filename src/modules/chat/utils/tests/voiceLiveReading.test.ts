/**
 * The live reading, judged against HAND-COMPUTED arithmetic.
 *
 * The module has no clock, no DOM and no network, so its whole product is arithmetic on the metrics
 * the path hands it. That makes the measurement exact: every expected number below is written out
 * longhand from the same constructed metrics, not read back off the implementation, so a change to
 * the formula (a ratio inverted, a factor dropped, the baseline's request count "fixed") moves the
 * reading and these cases go red rather than agreeing with the new one.
 *
 * The last block is the falsification half: the two mistakes this reading exists to catch — the
 * saved-ratio measured the wrong way round, and a baseline that quietly claims more than one
 * request — are computed here and asserted NOT to satisfy the criterion they would have to.
