/**
 * The segment pipeline judged by a CONTROLLABLE FAKE PROVIDER. Every reading in this file is
 * taken against a transport this file owns, so a case can put a segment out of order, make one
 * segment refuse, or overlap two segments' texts — and then assert what the pipeline made of it.
 *
 * ONE KIND OF CASE LIVES HERE: the pipeline's own properties. A fixed seed drives ≥200 randomized
 * inputs per property, because the failure this module exists to prevent — a wrong order, a
 * swallowed segment, a deduplicated word that was never duplicated — is exactly the kind that a
 * hand-written two-segment example can miss. The seed is fixed and the generator is re-derivable:
 * a red says which iteration and which input produced it.
 *
 * The single-keypress regression this file used to carry is gone with the path it pinned: there is
 * no batch upload beside the pipeline any more (see `useVoiceInput`), and the file entry now runs
 * through this same pipeline. `voiceTrimCapabilityWiring.test.tsx` owns the reading that a chosen
 * file leaves as WAV segments.
 *
 * WHY THE PREFIX-OVERLAP CASES USE SPACE-SEPARATED TOKENS. The audio overlap the segmenter
 * leaves is a few words; the text dedup is word-aligned, so the constructed texts are built
 * from distinct tokens whose only shared run is the intended one. That makes the expected
 * reassembly computable by hand (it is the concatenation of the cores) rather than by a second
 * copy of the dedup rule, so a wrong dedup cannot hide behind an identically-wrong oracle.
