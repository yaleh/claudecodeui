/**
 * The client ASR model's download and cache, judged against a host this file owns end to end.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING PINNED, AND WHY EACH READING MATTERS. The model is 239 MB, so the cache's promises are
 * the difference between a usable feature and one nobody waits for twice:
 *   - a valid cache hit makes ZERO requests, which is what the cache exists for;
 *   - a download that is truncated or does not match its pinned sha256 is NEVER written, which is the
 *     ordering defect the probe left behind (`docs/experiments/2026-10-06-voice-client-asr-probe.md`
 *     §5 called `cache.put` before validating) and the one rule this file must not regress;
 *   - a cache ENTRY that no longer matches is discarded and refetched rather than trusted;
 *   - a host with no Cache API, or one that refuses the write, still yields a working model plus a
 *     user-visible sentence — never a silent "it will download again every visit";
 *   - progress readings are cumulative, so they never go backwards.
 * Each of those is a case below, and each asserts the negative as hard as the positive: the
 * zero-request case fails loudly if `fetch` is reached at all, and the rejection cases assert
 * `cache.put` was called ZERO times rather than merely that a throw happened.
 *
 * THE DIGEST IS A STAND-IN, DELIBERATELY. `crypto.subtle` is not what these cases are about — the
 * CONTRACT around the hash is — so the injected `sha256Hex` reads the buffer's first byte and pads it
 * to sha256's width. That makes "this buffer hashes to the pinned value" exactly controllable and
 * collision-free by construction, so a case that means to test a hash MISMATCH cannot accidentally
 * pass because two real digests collided.
