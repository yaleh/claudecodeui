 * which runs it before rendering so a run of work rows can be drawn as one
 * segment. The selection is a pure function of the rows' types, which is what
 * makes it stable across the streaming tail, and it keeps the run's rows
 * verbatim — unlike `groupConsecutiveTools` it never folds same-name calls into
 * an xN layer, so a run of N calls has N members. A run of exactly one member is
 * emitted as that member itself rather than wrapped, which keeps a lone tool row
 * rendering exactly as it does today.
 *
 * The segment's `key` is its first member's intrinsic key, so the segment has an
 * identity the tail cannot re-mint.
