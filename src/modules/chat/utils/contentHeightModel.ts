/**
 * The transcript's drawn scrollbar geometry, estimated in pixels.
 *
 * A browser's scrollbar draws a thumb whose length is
 * `trackHeight * viewportHeight / contentHeight` and whose position is the
 * fraction of the content already scrolled past. The transcript cannot read
 * `scrollHeight` for that: the loaded window is only a slice of the
 * conversation, and rows that are not currently mounted hold a fixed
 * placeholder (100px) that is not their real height. This module models the
 * whole conversation in pixels instead — measured rows contribute their real
 * height, every other message contributes the running average
 * `pxPerMessage` — so the thumb keeps a browser-faithful length and a position
 * in the conversation, not in the loaded window.
 *
 * Every function here is pure; the DOM readings that feed them (which rows are
 * measured, the window's opening ordinal, the track's height) are the caller's.
 * Used by `TranscriptTurnRail` (the content-fits hiding rule) and
 * `TranscriptScrollbar` (the drawn length and position), and unit-tested
 * directly.
