 * It is not `QueuedMessageCard` and deliberately shares none of its skin. That
 * card is this client's own queue: it is shown while the message waits for *the
 * browser* to send it, and taking it back is a local edit. Nothing here waits
 * for the browser — the message is already the process's, and every state drawn
 * below is one the process reported. The one thing the two have in common is
 * that the user is looking at a message that has no turn yet.
 *
 * The bubble is the message; everything under it is the host's account of where
 * the command is. Which of the two is on screen is the whole state machine:
 *
 *  - `queued` — the message, the sentence saying it will be handled when the
 *    current answer finishes, and [withdraw].
 *  - `started` — no bubble and no [withdraw], just the sentence saying it is
 *    running now. The message itself is the turn's own rows at this point, and a
 *    bubble here would be a second copy of it.
 *  - `cancelled` — no bubble either, and a notice in its place: the message left
 *    the record with the queue, and what stays is that it was taken back.
