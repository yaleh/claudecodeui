 * Used by chat's transcript message list to draw one run of work rows — the
 * thinking, tool-call and subagent-container rows `groupWorkSegments` absorbed —
 * as a single record that is collapsed by default and expands in place.
 *
 * The record never drops a member and never reads one's prose: its title derives
 * the run's current action, count and elapsed span from the segment (see
 * `buildWorkSegmentTitle`), which is the one thing it does look at its members
 * for. Collapsed, it renders the header alone and calls `renderMember` zero
 * times; expanded, it calls `renderMember` exactly once per member, in order.
 * Because collapsing only withholds the members from the mount and never touches
 * `segment.messages`, a collapse → expand round trip restores the exact same set
 * of rows — losing rows, thinking blocks, tool calls or subagent containers is not
 * a state this record can be in.
 *
 * The expanded state is owned by the caller, not by the record: the record holds
 * no state, so a run that stops growing never changes which state it is in.
