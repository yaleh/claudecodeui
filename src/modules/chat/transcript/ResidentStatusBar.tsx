/**
 * The resident process's own facts, as the activity dock's expanded panel.
 *
 * This used to be a status bar with a life of its own above the transcript. It
 * drew three things: a busy/idle word for the process, a count of the leases the
 * host was holding, and the process's identity and lifecycle controls. The first
 * two were a *second* answer to "is this session working" — read off a one-second
 * `/api/session-hosts` poll while the activity dock read the server's own frames —
 * and two answers to one question is how a page comes to say "idle" in one place
 * and "busy" in another. They are gone. What the session is doing is the dock's
 * collapsed row, from the dock's one source, and this panel carries only the part
 * the dock cannot know: the address of the process holding the conversation, its
 * pid, and the controls that start, restart and close it.
 *
 * Every fact here comes from `GET /api/session-hosts` — the address, the pid and
 * the close reason included. There is no local mirror of any of them, which is
 * deliberate: this panel's whole subject is a process it does not own, and a
 * cached copy would be able to disagree with the process. The two controls that
 * change that process (`start`, `close`) go through the same hook, so their
 * effect arrives the same way.
 *
 * Nothing is rendered for a session that is not stored `resident`, so a
 * non-resident session's dock has no panel body to show even if it asked for one.
