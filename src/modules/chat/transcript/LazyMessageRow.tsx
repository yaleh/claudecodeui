 * long session used to commit tens of thousands of markdown/tool subtrees at
 * once — a gigabyte-scale tab. The wrapper element here always stays in the
 * DOM (carrying the row's `data-message-timestamp`, so search jumps and scroll
 * anchors keep working against unmounted rows), while the expensive subtree
 * exists only inside a band around the viewport.
 *
 * The placeholder reuses the row's last measured height, so scrolling back
 * through previously seen content changes no scroll geometry at all; rows
 * never yet measured use an estimate and rely on browser scroll anchoring
 * while they settle.
