 * Used by project-workspace's WorkspaceTitle, on the line under the session title and to the right

 * place that is the same on every viewport. It renders nothing for a session that is not stored
 * `resident`.
 *
 * It replaces the arrow on the activity dock. The dock was the only thing that could open the facts,
 * so it had to stay on screen between turns, in the message flow on a phone — and a panel that opens
 * inside the flow grows the transcript instead of floating over it: measured at 390x844, opening it
 * pushed its own lower ~140px past the bottom of the scroll area, with only an edge showing. The pill
 * lives in the header, outside the transcript, and the panel is a portal anchored under it, so
 * opening it moves nothing and nothing can clip it.
