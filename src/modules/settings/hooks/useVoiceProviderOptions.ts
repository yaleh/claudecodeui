 * names would be a second source of truth for the same fact, and the failure it produces is
 * silent: a provider that renames a field, or a new one that declares none, would keep being shown
 * the old form while every request it made used the new declaration.
 *
 * The declaration arrives as `credentialFields`; `null` is this hook's spelling of the payload's
 * own "this provider declares none of its own" (the field is absent for a provider reached
 * through the shared backend). The distinction matters to the form: `null` means "the shared
 * fields apply", while an empty declaration would be a provider with nothing to configure.
