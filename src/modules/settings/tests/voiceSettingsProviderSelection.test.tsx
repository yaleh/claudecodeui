/**
 * AC-142: the settings form's recognition-service select and the credential fields it renders.
 *
 * TWO READINGS, both about the settings document rather than about the form's markup for its own
 * sake. The first is that WHICH BOXES EXIST follows the selected provider's own declaration: the
 * payloads below are fabricated — no registered provider's id appears in this file — so a form
 * that rendered a set of its own, or one keyed off a known id, cannot pass. The second is that the
 * document the form SENDS still carries every field of the provider slot, which is the hazard this
 * whole change closes: the settings are saved as one whole document, so a field the client does not
 * carry is a field the next save deletes on the server.
 *
 * WHAT THE FABRICATED DECLARATION CAN AND CANNOT VARY, said plainly because the boundary is real:
 * the IDS, the labels and which of the three SLOTS a declaration fills are the test's to invent,
 * while the field NAMES have to be names the client stores — the storage is one document with fixed
 * columns, and the form refuses to render an input whose edits `updateVoiceConfig` would drop
 * (`isVoiceConfigField`; the `delta-asr` case below is that refusal, read as an absence). A payload
 * naming an unknown field is therefore not an untested case but an asserted one.
