 * Silence trimming for voice input, ahead of the recogniser.
 *
 * A dictation clip is mostly not speech. The talker waits for the mic, draws
 * breath between sentences, and stops talking well before the button is
 * released — all of it paid for in upload bytes and recognition latency, none of
 * it carrying a phoneme. This module removes that silence and *only* that
 * silence: every sample the detector calls speech is copied out verbatim, and
 * the speech itself is never resampled, time-stretched or otherwise touched.
 * `alpha` is therefore not a parameter here; there is no time-compression stage
 * to configure. That decision is deliberate and was taken on 2026-09-21: the
 * pause table below is frozen, and the module does not search for better one.
 *
 * The detector is an energy VAD with hysteresis, not a neural one. The question
 * this module has to answer is "did the trim delete anything the talker said",
 * and that question is only answerable against a detector whose decisions are
 * fully reproducible and inspectable — a frame-level probability model would
 * make every downstream reading depend on a black box. Its thresholds sit
 * between the measured noise floor and the measured speech level rather than at
 * a fixed dB value, so the same code works on a quiet close-mic take and a loud
 * far-field one.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of its arguments — no DOM, no React, no
 * clock, no network. The caller owns decoding the audio and re-encoding the
 * result; this module only sees a `Float32Array`.
