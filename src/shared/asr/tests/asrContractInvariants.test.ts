/**
 * The transcription seam's contract board, as the always-on half of the criterion.
 *
 * `scripts/asr-contract-invariants-check.mjs` is the operator command and
 * `scripts/asr-contract-invariants-check.test.mjs` is the fault injection that shows the board
 * going red under a mutation. Both of those run when someone runs them. This file is what runs on
 * every change, and it is deliberately the cheaper half: it drives the same board over the shipped
 * registry and over declarations written here, so a regression is a failing assertion rather than
 * something a reader has to notice.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS FILE IS CAREFUL ABOUT:
 *
 *   · IT DOES NOT RESTATE THE INVARIANTS. Every assertion below is about the BOARD — that it
 *     measured, that it scored an empty board as empty, that it reds a declaration which disagrees
 *     with the wire it feeds. A second copy of the probes here would be a second implementation of
 *     the contract, free to disagree with `shared/asr/asrInvariants.ts` while both stay green.
 *   · IT MEASURES A DECLARATION NOBODY WROTE FOR IT. The shipped adapter declares
 *     `honors.prompt: false`, so "the prompt is left off the wire" is the only reading the shipped
 *     declaration can produce — the opposite reading, `prompt-part-present`, is unreachable that
 *     way. The prompt-honouring stand-in below is what makes that axis two-sided: one adapter that
 *     sends the prompt because it declared it would, and one that lies about it and is caught.
 *
 * It lives under `src/` because that is where the unit suite is collected from; the modules under
 * test live in the repository-root `shared/` tree, reached through the `@shared` alias.
