/**
 * Runtime switches for the voice pipeline.
 *
 * Two things about the voice path have to be drivable from outside the app: whether a recording is
 * trimmed before it is uploaded, and whether the trim's own readings are printed. Neither can be a
 * build-time constant — `import.meta.env.DEV` is false in the bundle an end-to-end run loads, which
 * is exactly the artifact whose behaviour has to be judged — so both are named in the URL
 * (`?voiceTrim=off`, `?voiceDebug=1`) and remembered in `localStorage`.
 *
 * The URL is how a switch is *set*; storage is where it *lives*. A switch the URL names is written
 * back on load, so it survives the reload and the route changes that follow — a value that only
 * ever existed in the query string would be dropped the moment the router rewrote the URL.
 *
 * The query string is read once, when this module is first evaluated. That is the moment the
 * document still carries it, and an SPA route change afterwards must not unset a switch somebody
 * asked for.
