/**
 * The upload is written at 16 kHz — a third of the bytes — and it stays the same audio.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `prepareUpload` hands the recogniser a WAV re-encode of the trimmed
 * recording, and that WAV used to be written at the decoded rate (48 kHz, 96 KB/s of 16-bit PCM
 * before base64). The recognisers work at 16 kHz, so the extra rate bought nothing and cost two
 * thirds of every request — which is the difference between a long clip fitting one inline request
 * and being refused as oversize. This file pins both halves of the change: the audio survives the
 * resample (a 1 kHz tone is still 1 kHz, and nothing above 8 kHz folds back in), and the bytes
 * really shrink.
 *
 * THE ANTI-ALIAS ASSERTION HAS A FALSIFIER IN IT. "Downsample" is easy to satisfy by dropping every
 * third sample, and a decimation would pass any test that only checked the rate and the length. The
 * 20 kHz case is what tells them apart: above the 16 kHz output's Nyquist it must be filtered to
 * near-nothing, and the same measurement on a decimated copy — asserted right beside it — is full
 * strength. A test that went green under the fake form would be measuring nothing.
 *
 * The hook's own half is driven through `transcribeFile`, the same chain a recording travels, with
 * only the browser seams (no audio stack in jsdom) doubled — `src/shared/tests/voiceTrim.test.ts`
 * owns the DSP, and `voiceTrimCapabilityWiring.test.tsx` owns who decides whether it runs.
