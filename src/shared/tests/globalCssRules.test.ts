/**
 * The hand-written global stylesheet may not contain a rule that defeats the element it styles.
 *
 * `src/index.css` is the only authored sheet, and an audit of it against a rendered corpus (one rule at
 * a time: delete it from the CSSOM, re-read every matched element's computed style, put it back) found
 * three rules whose job was to be *general* and whose effect was to override what a component had asked
 * for. Each is pinned here as the shape of rule that must not exist, because the failure is invisible in
 * the rule itself — `white-space: pre-wrap !important` reads as a sensible default until it is seen to
 * beat the `white-space: pre` a syntax highlighter writes on its own `<pre>`.
 *
 * jsdom parses no Tailwind and lays nothing out, so this file reads the source. What a rule does to a
 * rendered page is `e2e/css-global-rules.spec.ts`'s job; this is the fast guard against reintroducing the
 * shape, and it fails with the offending rule's line so the red names the thing to delete.
