/**
 * The weak labels a send derives from the user's own edit — the known answers, the shape rule's
 * agreement with the offline index, and the negative control that keeps "rewrite" falsifiable.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING PINNED. `labelsFor` answers one question — which part of the final text did
 * this segment of speech become, and what changed there — and the answer is only useful if it is
 * THE SAME ANSWER a reader would give. So the criteria below are not "does it return something": a
 * fix that emitted one `rewrite` per segment would satisfy a shape-only assertion and teach nothing.
 * Each case names the pair and the op, and case ⑥ is the one where a plausible-looking answer is
 * the wrong one.
 *
 * THE SHAPE RULE IS PINNED AGAINST THE PYTHON IT WAS PORTED FROM. `isIdentifierShaped` is a port of
 * `is_id` in `experiments/voice-index-loop/sim/extract.py`, and the two are compared on a
 * known-answer table below. The table is not decoration: a label written by this module is scored
 * against a vocabulary the offline index built, so a rule that drifted by one token shape would make
 * every label about that token wrong in a way nothing else would notice.
 *
 * THE NEGATIVE CONTROL IS EXECUTED, NOT DESCRIBED. Section 4 builds a variant of
 * `src/shared/voiceEditLabels.ts` with the correction/rewrite boundary turned off — the budget
 * constants set to infinity, which is the "一律当纠正" reading — imports it, and shows that case ⑥
 * loses its `rewrite` on it. The unmutated module is named as the other arm, so the control cannot
 * pass by the case being red for some unrelated reason.
