/**
 * The shipped recogniser has to BE the effective provider, and its declaration has to be what the
 * trim decision reads.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. The trim gate answers "裁不裁" from a capability declaration
 * (`src/modules/chat/hooks/useVoiceInput.ts`) and the declaration comes from the registry — both
 * of which are pinned elsewhere. What nothing pinned is the JOIN between them: which provider the
 * declaration is read FOR. That join is a registration-order fact, and it is invisible from either
 * side. A tree can have one honest read point, one honest declaration, and still trim nothing,
 * because the adapter sitting at `listProviders()[0]` is the second one and its answer is `useful`.
 *
 * THE REGRESSION THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. The client used to carry its own `destructive` table, so
 * the join did not matter. Moving 裁不裁 onto the declaration removed that table — correctly — and
 * the default flipped, because the shipped recogniser this deployment actually posts to had never
 * been registered at all. Both halves of the fix are asserted below: the row exists, and it is
 * first.
 *
 * A NAME IS NOT AN IDENTITY. `listProviders()[0].id === 'openai-compatible'` would hold for an
 * adapter that declared the right string and did something else, so the last case drives the
 * adapter the registry hands back and reads the wire it produces. The claim being made about the
 * first row is that it is the recogniser this deployment sends audio to, and that is only true if
 * the row reaches the transcription endpoint with the audio in a multipart body.
 *
 * It lives under `src/` because that is where the unit suite is collected from; the module under
 * test lives in the repository-root `shared/` tree, which the frontend reaches through the
 * `@shared` alias (ADR-004 decision 2).
