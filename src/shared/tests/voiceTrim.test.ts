 * known duration, so "this speech survived" is checked against where the speech
 * actually is rather than against what the detector reported — a detector that
 * returned no regions at all would otherwise make every survival assertion
 * vacuous, and a trim that deleted a whole utterance would still "agree with
 * itself".
 *
 * The gaps are laid out so that one fixture walks the whole pause table: 0.36 s
 * lands in the "keep as-is" row, 0.60 s, 1.20 s and 2.60 s in the three capping
 * rows. Each row's answer is asserted where the audio is, so a table that had
 * silently been re-tuned would red here rather than in a benchmark months later.
