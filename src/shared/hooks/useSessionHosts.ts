/**
 * The resident-process snapshot, shared by every reader on the page.
 *
 * Consumed by the sidebar (the mark beside a session's provider logo), by the
 * chat transcript (the status bar and its popover) and by the composer (which
 * needs the session's stored lifecycle mode to know what its stop button means).
 * They all read one store rather than polling for themselves: three components
 * each holding their own copy would let the sidebar and the status bar disagree
 * about the same host for as long as their intervals were out of step, and the
 * readings that matter here are exactly the comparisons between them.
 *
 * The server now announces that the listing changed instead of the page asking
 * again and again: `GET /api/session-hosts` is still the one face that *builds*
 * the snapshot, but a `hosts_changed` frame is what says when to re-read it.
 * The store therefore has two inputs — {@link invalidateSessionHosts}, called
 * from the websocket bridge with the frame's revision, and a slow fallback
 * interval that only exists to cover the gap while the socket is down. The
 * revision is what makes the push safe against a slow read: a frame that names
 * a revision at or below the last one applied is dropped, so a re-delivered or
 * out-of-order frame cannot start a second read, and the frames a burst of
 * transitions produce are coalesced into one.
 *
 * The fallback interval is deliberately long while the socket is up ({@link
 * CONNECTED_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS}) — the frames are the signal then — and short
 * only while it is down ({@link DISCONNECTED_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS}), which is the
 * one case where nothing else would report a change at all. Either way it is
 * suspended while the tab is hidden, since nothing is looking at the result.

 * The busy/idle classification the whole page reads: which sessions are being

 * derived here, from the `turn` lease in the one-second `/api/session-hosts`
 * listing — which made the sidebar a second, slower answer to a question the
 * activity dock already answers from the server's pushed frames. Two answers is
 * how a page comes to say "idle" in the dock and "busy" in the sidebar for as
 * long as the poll lags, and the lag is real: a turn that ends is announced to
 * the page at once and observed by the listing up to a beat later. So the busy
 * set is the caller's — the same `SessionActivity` membership the dock and the
 * composer's stop entry read (`useBusySessionIdSet`) — and this function's job is
 * to place it against the listing that still owns the *other* group.
 *
 * The listing keeps exactly one job here: naming the resident sessions that are
 * held open with nothing to do. That is a fact about a process, not about
 * activity, and no activity source can report it — which is why the poll stays,
 * and why its reading is not allowed to decide busy/idle.
 *
 * Every lifecycle mode counts as running. A per-run session's process lives
 * exactly as long as its turn does, so a per-run session with a turn in flight
 * *is* one being worked on; narrowing this to resident sessions would silently
 * drop the turns the view was built to show.
