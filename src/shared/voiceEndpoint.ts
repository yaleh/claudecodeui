/**
 * Source-independent voice-activity detection: the frame decision, the streaming state
 * machine, and the endpointing that turns a speech run into upload-sized segments.
 *
 * `voiceTrim.ts` ran this decision as a batch — decode the whole clip, take the 15th
 * percentile of *its* frame energies as the noise floor, and flag frames against it.
 * That is correct for a clip that is already in memory and wrong for capture that is
 * still arriving: a live stream has no "whole clip" to take a percentile of, and a
 * dictation that never stops talking has no silence for the batch floor to find. This
 * module is that decision extracted so both paths can share it — the thresholds are
 * defined exactly once, here, and `voiceTrim.ts` imports them; a second copy of
 * `0.8 * ENTER_FACTOR` is the drift this split exists to prevent.
 *
 * Two things are added over the batch decision, and only two:
 *
 *   · a sliding noise floor — the low percentile of the last few seconds of *candidate
 *     silence* frames, rather than of the whole input. Candidate silence is a frame the
 *     current floor already calls quiet, so a long unbroken speech run cannot push the
 *     floor up into the speech and silence the detector against itself.
 *
 *   · endpointing — a sentence ends after `endpointMs` of continuous silence, and a run
 *     that reaches `maxSegmentSec` without a pause is force-cut at its quietest frame so
 *     one upload cannot exceed a provider's inline-body limit. Consecutive segments
 *     overlap, so a word sitting on a cut appears in both halves for the text layer to
 *     deduplicate.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of its arguments — no DOM, no React, no clock, no
 * network, no sample buffer retained. It is streaming in the sense that matters for
 * capture: it holds one 20 ms frame and two per-frame arrays (energy, flag), never the
 * audio.
