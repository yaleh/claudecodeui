/**
 * The weak labels a dictated sentence leaves behind when the user edits it before sending.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A user who corrects the recogniser's words in the composer has already told us
 * both halves of a training pair — what was heard, and what they meant — and they told us for free,
 * without being shown an interface for it. This module turns that edit into `heard → final` pairs:
 * for each segment of speech the listen committed, it finds the region of the final text that
 * segment became and reports what changed between them.
 *
 * IT IS A PURE MODULE, and that is what lets the rule below be judged without a browser, a
 * microphone or a clock: `labelsFor` takes the segments and the final text and returns the labels.
 * Nothing here reads a store, a config or a socket.
 *
 * THE TWO SIDES OF AN EDIT. A `replace`/`merge`/`split`/`delete` is a CORRECTION — a small, local
 * repair of what was heard. Anything past the budget below is a `rewrite`: the user did not correct
 * the recogniser, they said something else, and a `heard → final` pair built from it would teach the
 * wrong thing. Rewrites are still EMITTED — a reader can see that the region was touched — but they
 * are marked, and a consumer that learns from corrections must skip them. The boundary between the
 * two is the one judgement in this file, and `src/shared/tests/voiceEditLabels.test.ts` runs a
 * falsifying variant of this module with that boundary deleted, case ⑥ of the acceptance criteria
 * going red on it, so "rewrite" is a claim the test can lose rather than a word in a comment.
 *
 * THE SHAPE RULE IS SHARED WITH THE OFFLINE EXPERIMENT. `isIdentifierShaped` is a port of `is_id`
 * from `experiments/voice-index-loop/sim/extract.py`, and it is exported because the two must agree:
 * a token the offline index calls an identifier and one this module calls an identifier have to be
 * the same token, or a label collected here would be scored against a vocabulary that was built from
 * a different reading of the same text. The acceptance criteria pin a known-answer table over the
 * two implementations precisely so a drift between them is a red test and not a silent one.
 *
 * THE ALIGNMENT IS A PORT OF `experiments/voice-index-loop/sim/lib.mjs`. `alignRegion` and
 * `widenToWords` are the same algorithms the offline loop uses to map a gold span onto recognised
 * text, kept here so that "which part of the final text did this segment become" has one answer.
 */

/**
 * The five things an edited region can be.
 *
 * The first four are corrections — the user repaired what was heard, and the pair is worth keeping.

 * correction and must not be read as one.
