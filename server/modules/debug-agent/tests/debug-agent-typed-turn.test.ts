/**
 * The criterion for a typed turn: the prompt a person sends through the chat
 * transport must become a row in the transcript, and the REST read must return
 * it.
 *
 * Why the frames criterion does not cover this. `debug-agent-frames.test.ts`
 * (AC-124) drives the armed scenario through `POST /api/debug-agent/clock`, which
 * replays the scenario's own steps. Every row that arm sees is one the document
 * asked for — the seed's, or a step's. A prompt somebody *typed* arrives by a
 * different road: the chat transport's dispatch, carrying the text as the turn's
 * command. No step of any scenario has seen it, so the walk a typed turn starts
 * writes the assistant's answer and nothing else, and the user's own sentence is
 * never recorded. A build with that hole shows a live conversation that loses the
 * user's sentences at the next reload, and every existing criterion stays green
 * because none of them takes the typed road.
 *
 * Why the arm drives the socket handler rather than the runtime dispatcher. A
 * dispatch built by hand would have to reproduce the transport's options bag, and
 * the field this criterion turns on — the flag saying "this command is a message
 * somebody composed" — lives in that bag. A criterion that set the flag itself
 * would stay green on a build whose transport had stopped setting it, which is
 * the whole failure being measured. So the arm opens a fake socket and sends
 * `chat.send` through `handleChatConnection`, the same handler the websocket
 * server calls for a browser: the options bag, the run registration and the
 * dispatch are the product's, and nothing here restates them.
 *
 * What the two legs measure, and why both. The transcript leg is the artifact: a
 * row of `role: 'user'` whose text is what was sent, on disk under the fixture
 * root. The REST leg is the reader — `GET /api/providers/sessions/:id/messages`
 * reads those rows back through the product's own history service, which is what
 * a reload does. A build that forwarded the prompt as a frame without writing it
 * satisfies neither, and that is the false form this file runs as its own second
 * case rather than asserting about in prose.
 *
 * Why one child process per arm. The gate is evaluated once per process, the run
 * path opens the process's database, and the fixture home is a per-run scratch
 * directory, so a child per arm is the only way to take a reading without the
 * previous arm's state in it.
