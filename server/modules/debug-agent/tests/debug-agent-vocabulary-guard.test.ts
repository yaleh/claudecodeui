/**
 * ADR-003 decision 7 as a static guard — the file `goals/AC-126` names.
 *
 * The debug agent is allowed to construct dialect ROWS and nothing else: a
 * scenario says what gets written to a transcript and when, and every frame a
 * client sees is what the product's own normalizer makes of those rows. The
 * moment a frame or event name appears in this module, someone has started
 * building frames here, and "the debug agent goes through the same chain as the
 * product" stops being true — which is the only reason its output is evidence
 * about the product at all.
 *
 * Two halves, and neither means anything alone:
 *
 *  1. NO frame field name and NO event name appears in the module's source. The
 *     dialect's own field names (`type`, `message`, `content`, ...) are not in
 *     the vocabulary; the vocabulary is the WIRE's. The one `kind:` the module
 *     may write is a host LEASE's — see {@link HOST_LEASE_KIND_LITERALS}.
 *  2. The module really does import the product's normalization entry. Half 1 on
 *     its own is passed by a module that produces nothing at all, so half 2 is
 *     its complement: it says the row → frame edge exists and is the product's.
 *
 * Scope, and why it is the scope it is. The scan covers the module's own `*.ts`
 * sources, NOT `tests/`: `tests/debug-agent-external-write.test.ts` asserts on the
 * `session_upserted` broadcast by name, which is exactly what a behavioural test
 * should do. This guard lives under `tests/` too, so it is out of scope by the
 * same rule — and the test below PROVES that exclusion is load-bearing rather
 * than incidental, by scanning this file's own text and showing it hits.
 *
 * The honest upper bound. This reads LITERALS. A frame name assembled at runtime
 * from fragments, or read out of a config file, is invisible here. So this is the
 * static half of decision 7 and not a substitute for the behavioural criteria
 * (`AC-124`): "the frames really came out of the normalizer" is measured there,
 * on a run, against the artifact.
