/**
 * The debug agent's host driver: the process-lifetime face of a provider whose
 * "process" is a scenario walking a fixture transcript.
 *
 * Why a driver at all. Every other provider is driven by the session-host
 * manager's default per-run wrapper, which observes a run from the outside and
 * infers the single `turn` lease from the terminal frame. That wrapper can only
 * ever produce one shape — one process per turn — and the debug agent exists to
 * reproduce the *other* shape: a process that outlives a turn, serves several
 * conversations, and is held open for reasons the caller states rather than
 * infers. Being the provider that owns its process is what makes that
 * expressible, and the manager already has the seam for it
 * (`IProviderHostDriver`).
 *
 * What it does NOT do: build frames. ADR-003 decision 7 is intact here — this
 * file reports leases, exits and turn boundaries, and the frames a client sees
 * are whatever the product's normalizer makes of the rows the engine wrote. The
 * one place a run is opened goes through `openRun`, injected, because the run
 * registry belongs to the websocket module and this module may not reach it
 * (the registry registers this module's provider, so the edge back would close
 * a cycle).
 *
 * Nothing here is real. There is no child process, no pid, no OS handle — the
 * host the manager tracks is a record this driver answers about, which is
 * exactly what makes the shapes reachable in a criterion without a 24-hour wait
 * or a killed process. Every claim it makes is therefore a claim about the
 * manager's own arithmetic, which is the subject: who closes a host, when, and
 * for which reason.
