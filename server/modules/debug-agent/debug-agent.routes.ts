/**
 * The debug agent's dev-only control plane: the HTTP endpoints behind the three
 * operations ADR-003 decision 1 names — arm a scenario, advance the clock, read
 * the engine's self-check result.
 *
 * Why HTTP, and nothing else (decision 6). None of the three needs server push,
 * so a WebSocket would buy a handshake, an auth path and reconnect semantics for
 * nothing; and a CLI script would bypass the auth middleware, turning the face
 * into "any process on this host may drive it", while also becoming a second
 * entry point competing with this one over which is the control plane.
 *
 * Two things this module deliberately does NOT own:
 *
 *  - **Whether any of it exists.** The router belongs to `debug-agent.gate.ts`,
 *    which is the only reader of the gate variable and the only module allowed
 *    to decide whether the face is attached (`mountDebugAgentControlPlane` is a
 *    no-op while the gate is closed). Registering here, onto the router that
 *    module hands out, keeps the decision in one place: a closed gate means the
 *    endpoints were never registered as well as never mounted.
 *  - **The engine.** `POST /clock` drives the armed scenario through the
 *    product's own runtime dispatcher rather than calling `runDebugAgentScenario`
 *    here: the frames a run emits are the product's normalizer's output, and the
 *    session↔frame mapping belongs to that chain. The two dependencies that reach
 *    outside this module are injected for that reason — see
 *    {@link DebugAgentControlPlaneSeams} — because this module may not import the
 *    providers module (the registry imports this module's barrel to register the
 *    debug provider, so the edge back would close a cycle).
 *
 * The security boundary is the gate, not the credential (decision 6): the routes
 * run under the same `authenticateToken` every other protected route uses, which
 * answers "who are you". Only the gate answers "does this exist".

/**
 * What the control plane needs from the rest of the server, injected.
 *

 * inside a request handler: the object `server/index.ts` builds must not resolve
 * a provider — or read a runtime — while the gate is closed, because "closed"
 * means this face does not exist, not that it is guarded.
 *
 * Consumed by `server/index.ts`, which is the one module that imports both sides
