/**
 * Criterion: the dock's stop control against the **real provider capability
 * face** — the shipped matrix as the thing that decides, rather than a
 * substitute driver that accepts everything.
 *
 * Why this file exists. AC-196's criterion proves the control plane walks its
 * timing correctly, and AC-199's proves the browser draws the events — but both
 * drive a *substitute* host driver that accepts every stop (the debug agent's
 * `stopTask` returns `true` unconditionally, and AC-196's scripted query is
 * handed to the driver directly). Neither ever asks the question this task is
 * about: what does the product do when the provider's own capability matrix says
 * the verb is not there? On the tree this file was written against, the answer
 * was "the button looks live, takes the click, and nothing happens" — the
 * matrix said `stopTask: false`, the runtime therefore answered `unsupported`,
 * and no dock code had ever read the matrix at all.
 *
 * What is read here, and on which of the two axes:
 *
 *  The capability face (the shipped matrix itself):
 *   (AC1/AC3) `claude`'s resident `stopTask` declaration — the value the whole
 *        chain routes on, read from the same service the server reads it from;
 *   (AC2) that value being `false` is what produces `unsupported`, and the
 *        reading function below is what says so: fed the false-form data it
 *        throws, so a green main arm is evidence and not a coincidence.
 *
 *  The chain (the real `providerRuntimeService`, the real
 *  `ClaudeResidentHostDriver`, the real `chat.stop-task` handler, one temp
 *  database and one scripted SDK process):
 *   (AC1) a resident session's stop reaches the live query with the right task
 *        id, and the task leaves `running` only on the `task_notification`
 *        frame — never on the call, never on the receipt;
 *   (AC2) when the provider declares no such verb, the handler answers
 *        `unsupported` **before** it addresses the table, so even a task the
 *        table does not hold gets the verb-level refusal, and the driver is
 *        never reached;
 *   (AC3) the two readings of the same assertion: the pre-fix capability
 *        (the value the matrix carried before this change, injected through the
 *        same seam the matrix feeds) is RED under the AC1 reading, the shipped
 *        one is GREEN.
 *
 * The one substitute is the SDK process — the shape AC-196 already draws its
 * boundary at. The real-SDK hop was measured out of band and is recorded in the
 * completion record: a real `query()` against the real CLI, asked for a
 * background task and then stopped through `Query.stopTask`, answered
 * `task_updated{patch:{status:'killed'}}` + `task_notification{status:'stopped'}`
 * ~1.0s later, with the task's own process alive immediately before the call and
 * gone immediately after it.
