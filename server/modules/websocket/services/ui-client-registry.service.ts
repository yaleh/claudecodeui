/**
 * Which browsers are connected, keyed by the identity they announced.
 *
 * This is the server's answer to "which device is this", which a websocket
 * connection cannot give: the transport id is fresh on every reconnect, while a
 * device keeps one `deviceId` for as long as its site data lives. The registry
 * therefore holds identity *about* a connection rather than deriving it from
 * one, and it holds it in memory only — a device table would be a second source
 * of truth that outlives every reason to have one, and a restart is exactly when
 * that stale copy would be wrong.
 *
 * The lifecycle is the connection's, deliberately:
 *
 *  - a client announces itself once per connection with a `ui.hello` frame, which
 *    is the only thing that creates an entry (`register`);
 *  - the entry is dropped when that connection closes (`unregister`), because
 *    "this device is connected" is only ever a statement about a live socket;
 *  - nothing is polled and nothing is reported on a schedule — the announcement
 *    is the whole input, matching the lazy protocol the MCP tools are built on.
 *
 * Reconnects are the ordinary case, not an error: the browser re-announces the
 * same `deviceId`, so its tabs simply leave and come back.
