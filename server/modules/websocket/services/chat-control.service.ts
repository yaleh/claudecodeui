   * unauthenticated caller is refused without the provider being told anything;
   * the session must then exist and its provider must have a runtime before the
   * driver is reached. The verdict is the provider's own `abort` answer, so a
   * process that had already ended reports `aborted: false` rather than a
   * fabricated success.
   *
   * "Is there a run to abort" is deliberately **not** decided here. The registry
   * is the adapter's state and reading it around this call races the run's own
   * terminal event — an abort that kills a process can let that process's exit
   * path complete the run first, and a registry check made here would then turn a
   * real stop into a false `NO_ACTIVE_RUN`. The WebSocket handler checks the
   * registry *before* delegating (as it always has).
   *
   * The terminal `complete` for the aborted run is emitted here, immediately
   * after the provider answers, for the same timing reason: a stop that releases
   * an in-process generator (codex's forged stream, and its real SDK's abort)
   * can otherwise let that generator settle — and the run's own dispatch finish —
   * before an adapter several microtasks away got to write the client's frame,
   * which would surface the run as a plain failure instead of an abort. Emitting
   * it here keeps the exactly-one-complete contract identical to the old inline
   * handler. Every front end that aborts (the WebSocket gateway now, the MCP
   * gateway later) gets the same ending.
