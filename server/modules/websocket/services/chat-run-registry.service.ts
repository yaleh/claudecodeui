 * - `providerSessionId`: the provider-native id captured mid-run. The abort
 *   handler needs it to address the provider runtime, and the DB mapping is
 *   written from it so history/resume work after the run.
 * - `status`: drives `chat_subscribed.isProcessing`, prevents double sends
 *   into the same session, and guards the synthetic-complete fallback in the
 *   chat handler (only emitted when a runtime died without completing). It is
 *   also what a run read back by id reports — `running` until the terminal
 *   `complete`, then `completed` or, when that event was an abort, `aborted`.
 * - `runId`: opaque identity for this run, minted once in `startRun`. `seq` is
 *   numbered per run, so it is the `runId` that tells a reconnecting client
 *   whether its cursor still belongs to the run now in flight: the same id
 *   means `seq > lastSeq`, a different one means the cursor predates this run
 *   and replay must start at its first event.
 * - `lastSeq` / `events`: the per-run event log. Every live event gets a
 *   monotonically increasing `seq` and is buffered so a reconnecting client
 *   can replay exactly the events it missed via `chat.subscribe`.
 * - `source`: who asked for the run. Fixed at `startRun` and never rewritten,
 *   because it describes an origin that existed before the run did; it is what
 *   lets a run opened by the host layer (`unattended`) be told apart from one
 *   a timer fired (`scheduled`) even though neither has a socket attached.
 * - `bootId`: the identity of the process the run was created under, read once
 *   in `startRun` from the registry's injected boot reader (the activity
 *   protocol's `BOOT_ID` by default). A run record can outlive the process that
 *   made it only in the sense that a *later* boot can no longer tell whether an
 *   id it is handed belongs to it — this field is how the MCP gateway's
 *   `run_get` (AC-248) reports "服务已重启" instead of inventing a run.
