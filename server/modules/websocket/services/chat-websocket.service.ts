 * reaches the same audience as before. Left `undefined` by callers that only
 * ever have one socket, in which case `ws` is used.

 * table has no row for it — the id names a `tool_use` the tracker still holds as
 * pending. The handler therefore refuses every request whose `toolUseId` is not
 * the tracker's currently pending foreground tool, and never reads the task table
 * at all.
 *
 * The shape is "validate, address, place, report", and every refusal happens
 * **before** the driver is touched:
 *
 *  1. the three fields (`sessionId`, `toolUseId`, `requestId`) are required — the
 *     no-toolUseId "background everything" form is refused here, so the driver is
 *     only ever reached with a string id;
 *  2. the session must exist;
 *  3. the request must belong to the session (`assertSessionAccess`);
 *  4. the session's provider must declare the verb at all — a resident session
 *     whose matrix says `backgroundTasks: false` is `unsupported` here, before
 *     the tracker is consulted, for the same reason its stop sibling is;
 *  5. the requested `toolUseId` must equal the Turn Tracker's pending foreground
 *     tool (`readSessionForegroundToolUseId`) — anything else is
 *     `no-foreground-match`, with the driver un-called and no state moved;
 *  6. only then is the runtime asked, and the capability matrix decides whether
 *     the provider can carry it at all.
 *
 * The receipt never carries or writes a task state. `requested` means the request
 * was accepted and placed; whether the task then appears is the reducer's, driven
 * by the frames the CLI emits — this handler writes nothing and the tracker is
 * only ever read.
