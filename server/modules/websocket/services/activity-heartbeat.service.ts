 * interval it announced, so a criterion that wants the shipped defaults reads
 * these constants instead of re-typing 5000 / 15000.
 *
 * The beat is what a browser can see: the process already has a protocol-level
 * `ping` (see `attachWebSocketHeartbeat`), but that is invisible to page
 * JavaScript, so it cannot tell a client whether the server is still there. The
 * unreachable threshold is deliberately a small multiple of the interval, so a
 * client that stops hearing frames can degrade after a few missed beats rather
