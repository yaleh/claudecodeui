/**
 * The authoritative activity snapshot for one session: what the server knows the
 * session is doing, stamped with who is saying it and when.
 *
 * This is the record the whole activity protocol moves. A client never assembles
 * it by patching deltas — the server hands the *whole* thing on every change (see
 * `recordChange`) and hands the same whole thing over REST to a client that joins
 * late, so the two paths cannot disagree about what the session's activity is. The
 * fields are:
 *
 *  - `sessionId` — the app session id the client subscribes with. It is carried in
 *    the body (not only in the URL) so a frame and a snapshot are the same shape
 *    whether they arrive over the socket or over HTTP.
 *  - `bootId` — the identity of the running process, the same value the heartbeat
 *    frames carry, so a client can tell "the server restarted" from "the session
 *    is busy". It is *the same* value by construction: this module reads the one
 *    `BOOT_ID` the heartbeat owns rather than generating a second one.
 *  - `rev` — the session's monotonic activity revision. It is the single number
 *    that lets a client tell a continuous stream from one with a hole in it, and it
 *    has exactly one producer in the process (see `readActivityRevision`).
 *  - `asOf` — the instant the snapshot was produced, read from the injected
 *    `now()`. The protocol has no local clock of its own: every timestamp here is
 *    whatever the injected reader answered, so a criterion can pin it and a
 *    caller cannot be surprised by a value that came from `Date.now()` anyway.
 *  - `turn` — the session's turn phase, from the providers module's reduction.
 *    Transported, not computed here.
 *  - `tasks` / `schedules` — the session's live task and schedule projections. Their
 *    internal shape belongs to the reducers that own them (AC-191 / AC-192); this
 *    module only carries whatever the injected readers answer, which is why the
 *    element type is `unknown` rather than a shape redefined here.

 *  - `snapshot` reads the three live sources plus the current revision and
 *    returns a fresh copy; an unknown or retired session answers `null`.
 *  - `recordChange` is the one way a revision ever moves: it advances the session
 *    by one and pushes a whole-snapshot upsert to that session's subscribers.
 *  - `subscribe` registers one connection, hands it today's snapshot first, and
 *    returns its own unsubscribe. Two subscriptions to one session are two
 *    independent cursors.
 *  - `retireSession` drops the session's revision, snapshot and subscriptions —
 *    the retention policy, called when the session ends.
 *  - `sessionIds` lists the sessions the store still holds, for a caller asserting
 *    that a retirement really reclaimed one.
