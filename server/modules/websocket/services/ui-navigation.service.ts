/**
 * Telling one browser to open a session, and remembering what came of it.
 *
 * This is a PUSH, the mirror of {@link uiStateRequestService}'s pull. One call
 * writes a `ui.navigate` to ONE device's tabs, waits for the browser's DELIVERY
 * ack (a `ui.navigate_ack` saying `shown` / `applied` / `declined`) and then
 * returns — it does NOT wait for the user. An `ask`-policy device answers
 * `shown` at once and its human decides later; that later verdict arrives as a
 * `ui.navigate_result` frame, which updates the record this service is holding
 * in memory rather than a caller's already-returned value.
 *
 * The two frames are therefore DIFFERENT EVENTS, not two halves of one answer:
 *
 *  - `ui.navigate_ack` is "your instruction reached a browser" — a fact about
 *    the transport, matched to the pending call by its `navigationId`;
 *  - `ui.navigate_result` is "here is what the user decided" — a fact about the
 *    world, matched to the RECORD (which may be long since returned).
 *
 * Keeping the two apart is what makes "the tool never waits for the user" and
 * "the final outcome is still observable" both true at once.
 *
 * The in-memory log is bounded on purpose: at most
 * {@link UI_NAVIGATION_MAX_RECORDS} records, and nothing older than
 * {@link UI_NAVIGATION_RETENTION_MS}. A navigation is about a LIVE socket — the
 * tab that received it, the prompt it is showing — so a durable table would be a
 * second source of truth that outlives every reason to consult it. The log is
 * pruned on every write AND every read, so a caller asking "what happened" never
 * sees a record the retention window already retired.
