/**
 * Asking the browsers what they are showing, and collecting the answers.
 *
 * This is a PULL, not a presence store. Nothing is reported on a schedule and
 * nothing is cached: one call broadcasts a `ui.state_request` carrying a fresh
 * `requestId`, every addressed tab answers with a `ui.state_response` echoing
 * that id, and the call returns when either every asked tab has answered or the
 * window closes — whichever comes first. A tab that never answers is a fact the
 * caller reads (`unresponsive: true`) rather than a reason to fail: one closed
 * laptop lid must not make the whole question unanswerable.
 *
 * The `requestId` is what keeps two overlapping calls apart. Answers are matched
 * against the one pending request that minted the id and are dropped otherwise —
 * including an answer that arrives after its own request already returned, which
 * is why a late frame can never be read into the NEXT call's result. The id is
 * generated here and never reused.
 *
 * The same round trip is the primitive the other UI-facing MCP tools share
 * (`ui_clients_list`, `ui_open_session`), so a second tool asking a browser
 * something does not need a second protocol.
