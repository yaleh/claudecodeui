 * is a dependency, not a module-level constant: `server/index.ts` mounts it
 * over the process-wide singleton, and a criterion mounts it over a manager it
 * built and drove itself, so the listing it reads is the same table the
 * dispatch under test wrote.
 *
 * The listing does one thing — read the manager's snapshot and the injected
 * session reader, project both, wrap them in the standard envelope — and
 * deliberately does not import `chatRunRegistry` or touch the database. That is
 * not stylistic: the hosts are the host layer's own state, and a listing built
 * from the run registry would silently omit the hosts that exist *after* their
 * run ended (a `lingering` process, a held-stdin window), which is exactly the
 * state this endpoint exists to show. The session reader is a seam for the same
 * reason, from the other side: the rows are the sessions module's, so they
 * arrive as a value rather than as an import, and this module still reads no
 * database of its own.
 *
 * The listing reports two arrays for that one reason. `hosts` alone cannot show
 * a session whose process is gone, and "the server restarted and dropped my
 * resident sessions" is precisely a statement about a process that is *not*
 * there — a client could not tell it from "the session never existed", because
 * after a restart both look like an empty host table.
 *
 * The close route is the same principle from the other side: it addresses a host
 * by the *session* it serves (which is what a client knows), and relays a
 * decision the manager records. It does not terminate anything itself — ending
 * the process is the driver's answer to being closed, and for a resident host
 * that answer is stdin EOF. It is also the only route here that is mode-restricted,
 * and deliberately so: a `per-run` host's life is its turn's, and a caller closing
 * one would be reaching past the run that owns it.
 *
 * `/start` is that restriction's mirror image. A resident session's process is
 * opened lazily — on the first turn, or when the user asks for it here — and the
 * decision that reaches it (the four refusals, the idempotent already-running
 * branch, the launch-versus-bind choice) lives in
 * {@link startResidentHost}, this module's own service. `/close` relays
 * {@link closeResidentHost} the same way. Both service functions answer with a
 * named `LifecycleModeErrorCode` in a transport-agnostic result, so a client
 * tells "this session is not resident" from "there is no such session" from
 * "nothing is running for it" without reading prose, and a second transport (the
 * MCP gateway) can reuse the decision rather than restate it here.
