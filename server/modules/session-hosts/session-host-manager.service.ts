   *     one is written, or the new bind would collide with the single-writer
   *     index it is about to replace. Closing first is what makes the new bind
   *     legal rather than an exception to rule 2.

   *     the session, not with the target.
   *  3. **One conversation per process, unless the driver says otherwise.** A
   *     live host for the same provider and mode is reused only when its driver
   *     declares `multiplexedHost === true`; otherwise the second binding is
   *     refused with `host-not-multiplexed`. Refusing rather than silently
   *     starting a second process keeps the driver's declaration load-bearing in
   *     both directions, and keeps a misplaced `bindSession` from looking like a
   *     successful multiplex when the process is in fact single-conversation.
