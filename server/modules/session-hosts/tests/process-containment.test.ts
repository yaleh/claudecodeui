/**
 * Criterion for resident process containment under a memory cap (AC-167).
 *
 * A resident process that outgrows its cap must die *alone*: the shared resident
 * slice exists so the kernel's choice of victim is confined to the residents,
 * and the manager's host record must carry the kernel fact (`exited`/`oom`)
 * rather than an operator log line. This file drives the real machine for that —
 * real `systemd-run --user --scope` scopes inside `cloudcli-resident.slice`, real
 * memory-eating children, the real session-host manager — and reads four things:
 *
 *   (1) the wrapper's command line and the systemd units it really created carry
 *       the *injected* caps: `-p MemoryMax=<configured>`, `-p MemorySwapMax=0`,
 *       `--slice=cloudcli-resident.slice` verbatim, and a slice cap that systemd
 *       holds and that tracks the configured value.
 *   (2) a child that allocates past the per-session cap is reaped by the kernel,
 *       and the host the manager tracks for it reads `closeReason: 'exited'` with
 *       `closeDetail: 'oom'` — derived from the journal, never from the exit code,
 *       which is why a third child that merely exits non-zero is asserted to be
 *       `error` rather than `oom`.
 *   (3) the sibling child under the same slice, and this test process, are still
 *       alive after that kill.
 *   (4) the scope listing is empty once the scopes are stopped, with a *positive
 *       control*: the same read is required to name each scope while it is up, so
 *       "empty after" cannot be satisfied by a reading that never sees anything.
 *
 * Unevaluated, not green. A host without a usable systemd user manager cannot
 * answer any of the above, so the criterion prints why and exits 3 before
 * registering a single case. This host probes true, so every case below really
 * runs — a skip here would leave the containment story unverified while the file
 * still exited 0.
 *
 * The memory source is deliberately *bounded* (384 MiB, then idle). Two reasons,
 * both load-bearing: against a 96M cap it dies at the cap, and under the
 * falsification variant where the wrapper degrades to a direct `spawn` it stops
 * on its own instead of eating the host — the variant has to red on the readings,
 * not on the machine. It also has to *touch* every page (`b.fill(7)`): a large
 * `Buffer.alloc` is `calloc`ed and left unmapped, so an untouched hog never
 * charges the cgroup and no cap ever fires — measured here, not assumed.
