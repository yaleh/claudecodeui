/**
 * The MCP gateway's `session_create` / `session_interrupt` handlers (AC-250).
 *
 * These are the two stage-4 write tools that create and stop a session. Both are
 * ADAPTERS: they translate a tool call into calls on the production services the
 * WebSocket gateway already uses — `sessionsService.createAppSession` and the
 * shared `ChatControlService`'s `send` / `abort` — and translate the services'
 * structured answers back into the JSON-bodied payload the audited registration
 * seam renders.
 *
 * `session_create` creates the session ROW first, then, only when a non-empty
 * `message` was given, opens the first run through the SAME control service a UI
 * send uses and returns the run's id alongside the session's. With no message the
 * control service is never called, so "created a session" and "started a run"
 * stay different acts: the run id is produced by exactly one thing (a real send)
 * and its absence is the honest reading of "no run was started".
 *
 * A `permissionMode` argument closes the race between "create a session with a
 * first message" and "the mode that first message runs under": the mode is
 * checked against the provider's capability matrix before anything is created,
 * recorded on the row, and carried on the opening send so the first child spawns
 * with it — no `session_reconfigure` round-trip is needed before the message, so
 * that first turn is not left paused on an unattended permission prompt.
 *
 * `session_interrupt` stops the run a session currently has and NOTHING ELSE.
 * It calls the control service's `abort` and reports what that answered: a
 * resident session's process is owned by its host driver, so interrupting leaves
 * the process (and its pid) untouched — the adapter has no host-manager seam to
 * close a host with, which is what makes "the resident process survives" a
 * property of the shape rather than of a branch a later edit could flip. An idle
 * session is reported as `aborted: false` with a message that literally says
 * there was no run to abort, never as a fabricated success.
 *
 * Everything is injected ({@link McpSessionCreateDeps} /
 * {@link McpSessionInterruptDeps}): production wires the process singletons
 * (`server/index.ts`); the criterion wires the real `sessionsService` and the
 * real control service over its own fixture. The `project` / `session` arguments
 * arrive already rewritten to an id by AC-246's target gate, which is why the
 * create path only has to look the id up, never resolve a name itself.
