/**
 * The MCP gateway's `ui_visible_context` handler (gap-mcp-ui-visible-context).
 *
 * The tool answers "what is the user looking at, in which window, right now" by
 * ASKING the browsers rather than by reading a store: one `ui.state_request`
 * broadcast, the answers collected by the websocket module's round trip, and the
 * result grouped by device. Nothing is cached and nothing is reported on a
 * schedule, so the answer is what the browsers said during this call — and a tab
 * that did not answer is reported as `unresponsive` rather than dropped, because
 * "the laptop lid is closed" is part of the picture.
 *
 * Two rules decide the shape of what comes back:
 *
 *  - IDENTIFIERS AND RANGES ONLY. The round trip already projects each frame down
 *    to a fixed whitelist, and this tool returns that projection unchanged — it
 *    adds no field and reads no body. A caller that wants message text asks
 *    `session_read mode=around` with an id from here, which is the whole point of
 *    reporting a range instead of the messages in it.
 *  - LOCATING A DEVICE IS THE SAME QUESTION AS LOCATING A SESSION. `client`
 *    follows AC-246's resolution rules — an exact `deviceId` wins, otherwise a
 *    trimmed case-insensitive substring must hit exactly one device — and reuses
 *    the same two refusals: `TARGET_AMBIGUOUS` with the candidates when several
 *    devices match, and, when none does, the existing `INVALID_ARGUMENT` envelope
 *    carrying the query that matched nothing. No second not-found literal is
 *    minted for devices: this vocabulary keeps one code per category.
 *
 * The deps are injected (`server/index.ts` binds the registry's read port and the
 * process-wide round trip), so this module owns the behaviour and the criterion
 * drives the same two seams over its own fake browsers.
