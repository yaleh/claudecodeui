/**
 * The MCP gateway's ONE tool-failure envelope (AC-284).
 *
 * Every way a gateway tool can fail used to leave a different residue on the
 * wire, and none of them was machine-readable:
 *
 *  - a bare sentence in `content[0].text` — the audit wrapper's `Unauthorized.` /
 *    `Insufficient scope for this tool.` and the caught `Error.message` (which is
 *    how `session_read`'s not-found answer surfaced);
 *  - a JSON string smuggled THROUGH `content[0].text` — every tool's
 *    `refusal()` / `new Error(JSON.stringify(body))`, so a caller had to
 *    `JSON.parse` a prose field to learn the code;
 *  - no `structuredContent` at all, because the audit wrapper only fills it on
 *    the success path.
 *
 * This module is the single statement of the replacement: {@link mcpErrorResult}
 * builds the envelope, {@link McpToolError} lets a handler throw one directly,
 * and {@link toMcpErrorResult} normalizes anything else a handler throws (a
 * JSON-bodied `Error`, a `McpToolError`, a bare `Error`) onto the same shape.
 *
 * Two invariants the criterion reads back off the wire:
 *
 *  - `code` matches `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$` — a well-formed code, never a sentence;
 *  - `message` is a non-empty human sentence, and the ONLY human-readable field:
 *    `content[0].text` mirrors it so a text-only client still sees words, but the
 *    machine fields live in `structuredContent`.
 *
 * {@link MCP_ERROR_CODES} is the canonical vocabulary for the codes the GATEWAY
 * itself decides. A code forwarded from a service's own vocabulary (the control
 * service's `UNSUPPORTED_PROVIDER`, a resident host's `LIFECYCLE_MODE_*`, the
 * self-target guard's `SELF_TARGET`, …) passes through {@link toMcpErrorResult}
 * unchanged as long as it is well formed — a well-formed code is never silently
 * rewritten to a gateway one, because that would erase the service's reason.
 *
 * Consumers: `mcp-gateway.audit.ts` (the three failure branches of the audited
 * wrapper, plus the declared-input validation), every tool module's refusal path,
 * and `tests/mcp-error-envelope.test.ts`, which reads {@link MCP_ERROR_CODES} as
 * the expected code per probe class rather than re-typing the literals.

/**
 * The canonical codes the gateway decides for itself — the ONE vocabulary (AC-285).
 *
 * `SESSION_NOT_FOUND` is the ONE code for "the session does not exist", on every
 * tool that can say it — the split AC-284 removed had two different codes naming
 * that one category depending on where in the gateway the miss was noticed.
 * `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` is its project-side sibling; `TARGET_AMBIGUOUS` is
 * "several targets matched, so the gateway refuses to pick".
 *
 * `APPROVAL_NOT_FOUND` / `QUEUED_MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND` / `RUN_NOT_FOUND` were
 * declared by AC-284 but not MINTED by it: the tools that emit them
 * (`approval_answer` / `session_cancel_queued` / `run_get`) once answered a miss
 * as a normal payload. AC-287 converts all three to envelopes thrown through this
 * module, so a miss on those tools is now `isError` with the cause in `details`
 * (`{ reason: 'expired' | 'never_issued' }` for the two by-id reads) and the
 * successful payloads shrink to the cases that describe something that exists.
 * `APPROVAL_EXPIRED_OR_NOT_FOUND` is the one code `approval_answer` used to
 * report INSIDE its normal payload rather than as an envelope; AC-287 retired it
 * from the wire (the expired/unknown approval is `APPROVAL_NOT_FOUND` with
 * `details.reason`). It stays in this vocabulary because AC-285's criterion pins
 * the vocabulary key set in both directions and it is that record's entry — a
 * value a caller might still hold, not a code any tool mints.
 *
 * The record is `as const satisfies Record<string, McpErrorDescriptor>`: every
 * value is checked against the descriptor type, and {@link McpErrorCode} below is
 * derived from the SAME object, so the type and the record can never hold two
 * different key sets.
