/**
 * The production assemblies for the two optional deps `session_create` and
 * `session_interrupt` read (AC-278).
 *
 * AC-250 implemented both handlers and AC-251 the two host tools, but the
 * composition root (`server/index.ts`) never handed the gateway the three deps
 * they dispatch on, so every one of the four tools answered the AC-249
 * placeholder (`MCP_TOOL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`) in production. This module is the
 * missing half of the wiring: it turns the process singletons the composition
 * root already holds into the two deps bags {@link registerMcpWriteTools}
 * reads, and it lives OUT HERE — rather than inline in `server/index.ts` —
 * precisely so the AC-278 criterion can drive the SAME construction path the
 * production assembly takes instead of assembling a second, test-only bag (the
 * false-green this task exists to close).
 *
 * `sessionHostControl` needs no builder of its own: AC-251's
 * {@link createSessionHostControl} already IS the exported production
 * constructor over the session-hosts barrel, and both `server/index.ts` and the
 * criterion call it the same way.
 *
 * What each builder is handed is the RAW production seam, not a pre-chewed
 * entry list: {@link buildSessionCreateDeps} reads the active-project rows
 * straight off the project repository and does the `{id,title,path}` projection
 * itself, so "the project a `session_create` may target is an ACTIVE one" is a
 * property of the wiring rather than of a caller that remembered to filter. The
 * two `session_create` services are the real `sessionsService` methods, and the
 * control seam is the one `ChatControlService` every front end shares
 * (AC-233/AC-253) — a caller cannot point the gateway at a second one because
 * the bags carry the instance it was given.

 * is `sessionsService` — `createAppSession` mints the row, and
 * `switchSessionLifecycleMode` stores a lifecycle preference before the first
 * turn — and `control` is the one shared `ChatControlService` a message send
 * rides. The two `sessions` members are declared as METHODS so the real
 * service, whose `switchSessionLifecycleMode` takes the narrower `HostMode`,
 * stays assignable (method parameters are checked bivariantly); the builder's
 * own contract widens the mode to `string`, which is the tool's input type.
