/**
 * Fuzzy resolution of MCP tool targets (AC-246; SPEC
 * `docs/proposals/mcp-gateway-SPEC.md` v3.1 §259): a caller names a project by
 * `projectId` or a name fragment, and a session by `sessionId` or a title
 * fragment, and the gateway turns that reference into the ONE id a tool may act
 * on. Typing a 40-character id on a phone is not realistic, so the name path is
 * the one that gets used — which is exactly why it must never guess.
 *
 * {@link resolveMcpTarget} is the decision, pure over its injected data source:
 *
 *  - an exact id wins outright, BEFORE any name matching, compared verbatim, so
 *    a session whose id happens to read like another session's title resolves to
 *    itself rather than to the lookalike;
 *  - otherwise a trimmed, case-insensitive SUBSTRING of the title has to hit
 *    EXACTLY ONE entry;
 *  - several hits are ambiguous: every candidate is listed with its id and its
 *    title, and NO id is chosen on the caller's behalf — the result carries no
 *    "selected" field at all, so a consumer cannot mistake a guess for a hit;
 *  - no hit — including an empty or whitespace-only reference — is a not-found
 *    reading that names the query and the kind, and is returned rather than
 *    thrown, because "there is no such session" is an answer, not a crash.
 *
 * {@link McpResolveDeps} is the whole data source and it is injected. Both of its
 * lists carry ACTIVE entries only, which is what makes "an archived project or
 * session is never matched" a property of the wiring rather than a special case
 * buried in the matching rules: the resolver has no archived row to match.
 *
 * {@link resolveInputTargets} is the gate built on top of the decision. It
 * decorates a tool handler so that every `project` / `session` string argument is
 * resolved BEFORE the handler runs, and a failed resolution stops the call right
 * there — the handler body is never entered, so no write can reach the control
 * or host service against a target nobody named. The refusal is raised as a
 * JSON-bodied error, which is what BOTH registration paths turn into an
 * `isError` tool result (the audited seam AC-244 landed, and the SDK's own
 * handler catch): one body, every seam, and the audit row records `error`
 * rather than a misleading `ok`.
 *
 * Consumers: `mcp-gateway.transport.ts` applies the gate to every tool the
 * gateway registers; AC-245's read tools, AC-249–AC-251's write tools and
 * AC-250's `session_create` reuse {@link resolveMcpTarget} /
 * {@link resolveInputTargets} instead of re-deriving a target. This module's
 * criterion drives both directly.
