/**
 * `/mcp` bearer-token authentication (AC-241, extended by AC-263).
 *
 * `/mcp` accepts personal access tokens (`ccp_…`) issued by the OAuth module and,
 * once the MCP OAuth switch is on, OAuth access tokens (`cca_…`) issued by the
 * authorization server. The middleware parses `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
 * with the SAME shared parser the `/api/oauth/token-info` route uses, hands a
 * `ccp_` token to the INJECTED `AccessTokensService` and every other token to the
 * INJECTED OAuth verification seam (AC-263), and refuses everything that fails
 * with one identical 401 body.
 *
 * The prefix is a ROUTING hint, never a trust boundary: a `ccp_` value is still
 * verified by the token service and a non-`ccp_` value by the OAuth seam, so a
 * forged prefix reaches no shortcut.
 *
 * The two services are injected, never constructed here: `server/index.ts` builds
 * one token service and one OAuth seam and feeds them in, so a process has
 * exactly one verification path per token kind. The middleware deliberately does
 * NOT branch on a rejection reason — not_found, expired, revoked, invalid_prefix,
 * insufficient_scope, a wrong audience and an unknown OAuth token all answer the
 * same bytes, so `/mcp` cannot be used as an oracle. Revocation and expiry take
 * effect on the next request because each service re-reads its row on every call.
 *
 * While OAuth is on, every rejection also carries the RFC 9728 `WWW-Authenticate`
 * challenge pointing at this resource's protected-resource metadata, so a client
 * can DISCOVER where to authenticate (AC-263 leg (a)). The switch is read through
 * `readMcpOauthEnabled` (AC-242's single reader) on EVERY request, never cached,
 * so a criterion can flip it in one process.
 *
 * This module imports no database handle, hashes no token and never re-implements
 * verification: it only calls the injected seams.
