/**
 * The MCP gateway's stage-6 resident tools (AC-271, extended by AC-272).
 *
 * This module owns the one statement of "which stage-6 tools exist and the scope
 * each requires": {@link MCP_STAGE6_RESIDENT_TOOLS}. AC-271 delivers exactly one
 * — `session_cancel_queued`, requiring `cloudcli:session:control` — and later
 * stage-6 tasks (AC-272 `session_reconfigure`/`session_background`, AC-273/274
 * `approvals_list`/`approval_answer`) ADD their tools alongside it. AC-252's
 * self-referential guard reads the gateway write-tool names from the gateway's
 * own tables, so those names must stay the single source of truth.
 *
 * WHY AC-272 AND AC-273 DO NOT APPEND TO THE TABLE. AC-271's criterion pins the
 * table's observable contents — `MCP_STAGE6_RESIDENT_TOOLS.map((t) => t.name)`
 * must deep-equal `['session_cancel_queued']` — and AC-272 / AC-273 are barred
 * from editing that criterion (it is a frozen no-regression surface). Growing
 * the table therefore has to happen in the SAME change as widening that
 * assertion, which is a later task's job. AC-272's `session_reconfigure` and
 * AC-273's `session_background` register through the same seam, gated on their
 * deps being present, so AC-271's cancel-queued-only mount keeps registering
 * exactly what it did before. The name/scope SOURCE for an added tool is its own
 * registration function (whose literal name is the one place it is written) plus
 * AC-243's scope vocabulary below — there is still one place per fact.
 *
 * {@link registerMcpResidentTools} installs each name through the SAME audited
 * registration seam AC-244 landed (the transport builds one over `withMcpAudit`,
 * so every tool inherits its audit row and its scope refusal). It is called by
 * `mountMcpGateway` alongside the read and write tools, over the one control
 * service instance the composition root already supplied (`server/index.ts` —
 * never a second instance).
 *
 * The scope literal comes from AC-243's single scope vocabulary
 * (`ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPES`) rather than being re-typed here, matching the stage-4
 * write table; the array's order is pinned by the OAuth module's own vocabulary
 * criterion, so the positional read cannot silently select the wrong scope.
