/**
 * The MCP gateway's `session_start` / `session_close` handlers (AC-251).
 *
 * These two stage-4 write tools start and stop a session's resident host. They
 * are ADAPTERS and nothing more: the whole of "should this session start" — no
 * such session, a host already serving it in another mode, a stored preference
 * that is not residential, a provider with no host driver, and "already running
 * is a success" — lives in the session-hosts module's `startResidentHost` /
 * `closeResidentHost` (AC-236), and this file delegates to those two functions
 * through {@link McpSessionHostDeps.hosts} rather than re-deriving any of it.
 * That delegation is the point: a second copy of the start/close decision inside
 * the gateway is exactly what this task exists to prevent, and the criterion's
 * spy counts (the service was reached on every call; the driver launched once)
 * are the mechanical evidence.
 *
 * What this file DOES own is the one decision the service deliberately does not
 * make: the `force` gate. `closeResidentHost` closes a live resident host
 * unconditionally — it reads the binding's leases back only to REPORT them — so
 * a caller that wants "refuse while a cron or background-task lease is held" has
 * to ask BEFORE it delegates. That ordering is load-bearing: once the host is
 * closed its leases are gone (the manager clears them on teardown), and a check
 * placed after the close could no longer read "the host is still running". The
 * gate therefore runs first, and its refusal is a structured error the caller
 * can branch on, naming the lease kinds and how many of each are held.
 *
 * Everything the services need is injected ({@link McpSessionHostDeps}): the
 * `hosts.start` / `hosts.close` pair (production: {@link createSessionHostControl}
 * over the session-hosts barrel), and a read-only `liveHost` port that answers
 * the `force` gate's one question — is a resident host serving this session, and
 * what is it holding. `liveHost` reads `snapshot()` for the same reason the
 * service's own `liveHostForSession` does: it is the manager's published read
 * port, and a `closed` host is skipped so the gate never blocks a close that has
 * already happened. It starts nothing and closes nothing.
