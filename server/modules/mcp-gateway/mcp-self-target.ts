/**
 * The MCP gateway's self-referential guard (AC-252; SPEC
 * `docs/proposals/mcp-gateway-SPEC.md` v3.1 §290–§300).
 *
 * A gateway client can itself be a CloudCLI session — the canonical nesting is
 * "a Claude Code session opened inside CloudCLI calling CloudCLI's own MCP
 * server". When that session calls a WRITE tool against ITSELF it does not just
 * act on a stranger: `session_send` queues a message behind the round that is
 * waiting for this very tool result, and `session_interrupt` / `session_close`
 * kill the round the tool result was going to return into. The request
 * deadlocks, so the tool must be refused before it reaches the control or host
 * service.
 *
 * The rule (SPEC §296). The target session's CURRENT turn is running a gateway
 * WRITE tool — `phase === 'tool'` and the pending `tool_use`'s raw name matches
 * `^mcp__.+__(<gateway write tool name>)$` — then the four write operations
 * named in {@link MCP_SELF_TARGET_WRITE_OPS} are refused with
 * {@link SELF_TARGET_CODE}. Two properties are load-bearing and are what the
 * criterion pins:
 *
 *  - **The server alias is arbitrary.** The `<server>` segment is whatever the
 *    user typed in `.mcp.json` (`cloudcli`, `my-cc-ui`, `x`, …), so the suffix
 *    is taken at the LAST `__` boundary and matched against the write-tool NAMES
 *    — never against a hard-coded `mcp__cloudcli` server prefix. An alias that
 *    merely starts with `mcp__cloudcli` is not special; an alias that does not
 *    is not exempt.
 *  - **The write-tool names come from the registry, not a second copy.** The
 *    names are injected ({@link SelfTargetDeps.writeToolNames}); the dispatch
 *    point supplies them from `MCP_STAGE4_WRITE_TOOLS`, so adding a write tool
 *    there widens the guard with no edit here. A module-local array would be
 *    exactly the drift the SPEC forbids.
 *
 * The guard is a HEURISTIC and errs on the safe side: another MCP server that
 * happens to expose a gateway-named tool triggers it too. `TurnState.toolName`
 * is only produced by Claude's turn-phase reducer today, so a non-Claude
 * session reads as `idle` and never triggers the guard (SPEC §297); the
 * criterion injects its own turn reader, so the rule is exercised without a
 * real Claude run.
 *
 * Consumers: `mcp-gateway.write-tools.ts`, whose `registerMcpWriteTools` wraps
 * every registered write tool with {@link buildSelfTargetGuard} BEFORE the
 * handler — so a blocked call never reaches the control or host service and
 * leaves an `error` audit row rather than an `ok`. This module's criterion
 * drives both exports directly and through the real `/mcp` mount.
 *
 * `phase !== 'tool'` is a RELEASE, not a block: the turn-phase reducer leaves
 * `toolName` set to the previous turn's tool while the phase moves on, so a
 * guard that read `toolName` alone would refuse a session that is merely idle
 * after having run a gateway tool. Only a LIVE pending tool counts.
