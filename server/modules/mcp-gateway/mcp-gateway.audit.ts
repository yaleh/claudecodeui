/**
 * MCP tool-call auditing (AC-244).
 *
 * Every tool invocation writes EXACTLY one row to `mcp_audit_log`, whatever its
 * result: `ok`, `denied` (the token lacks a required scope, so the handler never
 * runs) or `error` (the handler threw). The arguments are reduced to a digest
 * before they reach the database — session and project ids are kept verbatim,
 * every other string is replaced by its length and first 40 characters — so the
 * full text of a tool call can never be read back out of the log.
 *
 * The retention sweep and the audit dispatch are both injectable: the clock and
 * the interval scheduler are seams, so a criterion can plant an old row or
 * capture the daily callback without waiting on wall time. The module holds no
 * module-level timer or cache, so an injected seam is never shadowed by state
 * left over from another mount.
 *
 * Consumers: `mcp-gateway.transport.ts` registers tools through
 * {@link withMcpAudit} and starts retention at mount time; this module's
 * criterion drives every export directly.

 * declares an output schema gets its result emitted as `structuredContent`

 * throw) returns through {@link mcpErrorResult} / {@link toMcpErrorResult}, so

 *
 * A registration may also declare `annotations` (AC1–AC7) and `meta` (AC-285);
 * both are forwarded to `registerTool` verbatim and appear on `tools/list`, but
 * they are metadata only — the `denied`/`ok`/`error` decision below is made from
 * `requiredScopes` alone, so a declaration can never widen or narrow what a
 * token may call.
 *
 * An optional second argument threads AC-303's write-notification seam. It is
 * called ONLY from the `ok` branch, AFTER the audit row is written, and is wrapped
 * in its own try/catch: a throwing notifier must not change the tool call's
 * result nor turn the `ok` row into an `error` one. The seam is handed every
 * registration (read and write alike) and classifies each call itself — a
 * read-only tool returns without notifying — so the write/read split stays in
