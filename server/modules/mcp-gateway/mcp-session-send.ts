/**
 * The MCP gateway's `session_send` handler (AC-249).
 *
 * `session_send` opens a chat run through the SAME control service the
 * WebSocket gateway and the scheduled-message timer use, and returns the run's
 * id IMMEDIATELY — the run keeps going after the tool call resolves. That
 * immediacy is structural, not a timeout: the wait loop lives only inside the
 * `waitSeconds > 0` branch (routed through AC-248's `buildRunGet`), so a
 * default-`waitSeconds` call has no `sleep` reachable from it at all.
 *
 * What this module owns is the ADAPTER half: the caller is the token's owner
 * (`{ userId, via: 'mcp' }`), the control service's structured refusals are
 * translated into JSON-bodied errors the audit wrapper turns into an `isError`
 * result, and the two facts the control service cannot state — the run's
 * recorded `source` and, on `RUN_IN_PROGRESS`, the id of the run that is still
 * in flight — are read back from the run registry.
 *
 * Everything is injected ({@link McpSessionSendDeps}): the control seam, the run
 * reader, and the `run_get` builder plus its deps. Production wires the process
 * singletons (`server/index.ts`); the criterion wires the real control service
 * over its own fixture and the real `buildRunGet` over a fake clock. The module
 * holds no clock of its own — it never calls `Date.now()` or `setTimeout`, so
 * the bounded wait moves only through the injected `now`/`sleep` inside
 * `buildRunGet`.
 *
 * AC-272 adds the optional {@link McpSessionSendSelection}: when it is wired, an
 * options-less send reads the session's recorded model/effort/permissionMode and
 * puts them on the run, so a `session_reconfigure` a caller made is what the next
 * `session_send` actually runs with. Absent, the send is byte-identical to
 * AC-249's.
