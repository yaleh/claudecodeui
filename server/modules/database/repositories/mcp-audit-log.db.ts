/**
 * MCP tool-call audit-log repository (AC-244).
 *
 * Persists one row per MCP tool invocation (mcp-gateway-SPEC §389). The writer is
 * the mcp-gateway module's audit wrapper, which reduces the tool arguments to a
 * digest before calling here — this repository stores whatever `argsDigest` it is
 * handed and never inspects the arguments itself.
 *
 * `at` is caller-supplied when given (the retention criterion plants rows days
 * old to exercise the sweep) and falls back to the column's `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
 * default, matching how the audit wrapper writes "now" without reading the clock
 * twice. `deleteOlderThan` deletes strictly before the cutoff, so a row exactly
 * on the boundary is retained.
 *
 * Consumers: server/modules/mcp-gateway (mcp-gateway.audit.ts, which writes the
 * rows) and server/modules/settings (via the mcp-audit reader's
 * `listRowsForTokens` seam, which reads one user's rows back for the MCP-audit
 * settings page), both through the database module barrel.
