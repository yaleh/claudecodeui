   * name is one an indexer wrote — the placeholder an early scan fell back to,
   * or a name written before the two columns were split — and it sits in the
   * override column only because that is where indexer-supplied names used to
   * go. Leaving it there would freeze it: the projection reads the override
   * first, so a session discovered before it had a title would show the
   * placeholder for as long as it existed, with the transcript's own name
