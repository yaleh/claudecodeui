/**
 * Reads and writes the one row of the browser's last-opened session.
 *
 * WRITE SIDE IS BROWSER-ONLY. This repository has no notion of who is calling,
 * so the guard that "an MCP token's read must not move the pointer" lives one
 * layer up: only the provider's browser session-read routes call
 * `record` (through `uiLastOpenedSessionService`), while the MCP gateway's
 * `session_read` reaches the transcript through the sessions service and never
 * touches this table.
 *
 * ONE ROW AT A TIME. `record` first drops every other session's row and then
 * upserts the opened one, inside a transaction so a reader can never observe two
 * rows mid-replace. That makes "the last-opened session" a single reading rather
 * than a `max(opened_at)` query whose answer would change meaning if a clock
 * went backwards.
 *
 * Consumers: `uiLastOpenedSessionService` (the providers module's write/read
 * seam, called by the browser session-read routes and assembled into the MCP
 * gateway's `ui_last_opened_session` tool by `server/index.ts`).
