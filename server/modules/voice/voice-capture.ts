 * status is what makes that a malformed ANSWER rather than a refusal — so a 404 carrying the same
 * code falls through to the transport test below and is reported as what it is.
 *
 * The last two are decided by whether a request ever left the process, which is why `requestSent` is
 * an input rather than something the builder infers: an attempt refused before the transport never
 * sent anything, and an attempt whose request went out is an upstream failure whether or not an
 * answer came back readable. `upstream` is still an input, because the envelope test needs the status
