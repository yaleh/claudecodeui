/**
 * The falsifying forms behind `voice-error-contract.test.ts`, plus the exit-code half of AC6.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN MORE READINGS. A green criterion is evidence only if a broken
 * implementation would have made it red, and that claim is not something a passing run can show about
 * itself. So each case here builds a BROKEN copy of a shipping module by a one-line text mutation,
 * runs the whole reading list against it, and requires the readings it predicts to fail. The two
 * mutations are the two cheap ways to satisfy this task's words while missing its subject:
 *
 *   · `upstream-failure-without-code` — the service's provider-failure return drops `code`, which is
 *     exactly the shape the tree had before this task. Every sentence about "the envelope carries the
 *     code" is still literally implemented at the route (`sendFailure` still republishes whatever the
 *     service gave it), and the client is back to a status number it cannot tell two remedies apart
 *     by. If this case passes, AC2's per-arm readings are not measuring the service.
 *   · `raw-body-copied-through` — the value that rides in `upstreamCode` is the upstream's answer
 *     text instead of the code string extracted from it. The field exists, it is non-empty on every
 *     upstream arm, and the page now receives an upstream's prose — which is what "read the code off
 *     the answer" must not become. If this case passes, AC3's shape/length/substring readings and
 *     AC4's leak readings are not measuring what they say they measure.
 *
 * EACH CASE HAS THREE PARTS, and the first is what keeps the other two from being vacuous:
 *   1. the UNMUTATED copy must clear the whole list (a harness that is red for its own reasons proves
 *      nothing by going red on a mutant);
 *   2. the MUTATED copy must red at least one reading in the predicted family, and the red reading is
 *      printed by name so the failure is attributable;
 *   3. some reading OUTSIDE that family must still be green, so "the whole rig broke" is not what the
 *      red means.
 *
 * THE COPIES LIVE IN THE SAME TREE as the files they copy (`server/modules/voice/`), because a
 * module's imports are relative — `../../../shared/asr/asrRegistry.js` — and a copy in the OS temp
 * directory would not resolve them. Each copy gets its OWN path, because ESM caches a module by URL:
 * a mutant written over the base copy's path would import the already-evaluated base module and the
 * run would measure nothing. A copy of the SERVICE module still imports the SHIPPING routes module,
 * which is exactly what makes the two cases independent of each other — each mutation is the only
 * difference between its mutant and its base. THAT DIRECTORY IS SHARED: the sibling criteria that
 * build temp copies (`voice-capture-off`, `voice-capture-text`, `voice-dashscope-settings`) write the
 * same `__criterion-falsify-` prefix there and the suite runs them concurrently, so the tree-half
 * reading is scoped to this process's own copies — the AC5 case's doc comment says why.
 *
 * WHY AC6'S EXIT CODES ARE HERE. AC6 asks for the exit code of seven existing criteria plus
 * `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`, each printed rather than assumed. Those are SUBPROCESSES,
 * and AC1 requires the criterion file itself to start none inside a fifteen-second budget — one
 * `npm run typecheck` alone is most of that budget. This file is the task's other executable
 * artifact, it already starts `git`, and it is not the file the target-side gate runs. The in-process
 * half of AC6 (the `voiceTranscribeGaps` reading this task re-pinned) is where that line is, in the
 * criterion file's own subject matter — the other criteria are read here, by exit code.

 * `voice-capture-off`, `voice-capture-text` and `voice-dashscope-settings` build their own
 * `__criterion-falsify-*` copies in the SAME directory, and the suite runs four files at a time. So a
 * sibling's copies are untracked lines in this file's tree through no act of this file's, and a

 * this reading runs — which made the snapshot-vs-sample comparison report "changed" on a tree whose
 * final state was empty. That is a cross-PROCESS artifact, not residue, so the comparison forgives
 * exactly that and nothing else:
 *
 *   · THIS run's own copies stay an unconditional red (`own-temp-copies`), so the property AC5 names
 *     — no temp copy of this run survives — is asserted at full strength, and more precisely than
 *     before (the old reading reported a sibling's copies as if they were this run's);
 *   · a difference is forgiven ONLY when every line in it is a temp copy belonging to another pid.
 *     Any other added, removed or modified path — a copy of this run's, a stray file, a touched
 *     tracked file — keeps the red, and the failure prints both sides of the delta;
 *   · a foreign copy present in BOTH snapshots contributes no difference at all and needs no
 *     forgiveness.
