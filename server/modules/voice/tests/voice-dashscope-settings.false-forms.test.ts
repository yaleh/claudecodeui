/**
 * The falsifying forms behind `voice-dashscope-settings.test.ts` — AC4's executable cases.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN MORE READINGS. A green criterion is evidence only if a broken
 * implementation would have made it red, and that claim is not something a passing run can show
 * about itself. So each case here builds a BROKEN copy of the shipping service by a one-line text
 * mutation, runs the whole reading list against it, and requires the readings it predicts to fail.
 * The two mutations are the two cheap ways to satisfy the task's words while missing its subject:
 *
 *   · `key-plaintext-echo` — mask nothing. Every sentence about "the key is masked on the readback"
 *     is still literally implemented (there IS a mask function, it IS called on the readback face)
 *     and the credential is handed to the client. If this file's first case passes, AC5's masking
 *     readings are measuring the mask rather than the intent.
 *   · `env-only-configured` — ask the deployment rather than the user. `providerConfigured` keeps
 *     its per-provider shape and its per-provider call sites; it just stops reading the document.
 *     This is the regression the task exists to prevent, and if the second case passes, AC3's
 *     per-provider readings are not measuring whose credential decides the answer.
 *
 * EACH CASE HAS THREE PARTS, and the first is what keeps the other two from being vacuous:
 *   1. the UNMUTATED copy must clear the whole list (a harness that is red for its own reasons
 *      proves nothing by going red on a mutant);
 *   2. the MUTATED copy must red at least one reading in the predicted family, and the red reading
 *      is printed by name so the failure is attributable;
 *   3. some reading OUTSIDE that family must still be green, so "the whole rig broke" is not what
 *      the red means.
 *
 * THE COPIES LIVE IN THE SAME TREE as the file they copy (`server/modules/voice/`), because the
 * module's own imports are relative — `../../../shared/asr/asrRegistry.js` — and a copy in the OS
 * temp directory would not resolve them. Each copy gets its OWN path, because ESM caches a module by
 * URL: a mutant written over the base copy's path would import the already-evaluated base module and
 * the run would measure nothing. Both are deleted in a `finally`, and the last reading below states
 * that in a way the repository can check — the temp copies are untracked files, so a run that left
 * one behind is visible in `git status --porcelain`.
