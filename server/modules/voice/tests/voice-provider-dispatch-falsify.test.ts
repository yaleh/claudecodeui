/**
 * AC-139's falsification: the dispatch is not a claim, it is the thing the criterion is measuring.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE FROM THE CRITERION. The criterion reads the dispatch by driving the
 * two providers through one service. That reading would go green in a tree where the service had
 * been rewritten to always send the multipart wire and `tryResolve(providerId)` had been replaced
 * by `tryResolve('openai-compatible')` — the positive control in the criterion names the OTHER
 * provider, so the two shapes could both be produced by the same code path. What makes the reading
 * mean something is a case that BREAKS the dispatch and shows the criterion noticing:
 *
 *   1. a temporary tree built from the SHIPPING files (`voice.service.ts` and the `shared/asr`
 *      graph it reaches), with the criterion itself copied in beside them;
 *   2. the same driver run on that tree UNMUTATED — the positive control, first, so the red below
 *      cannot be a broken tree, a missing file or a driver that never ran;
 *   3. the same tree with one line changed, once per entry in `MUTATIONS`: the adapter that serves
 *      every request hardcoded to the multipart one, so the selected provider no longer decides the
 *      wire; and the error table's `UNAUTHORIZED` row moved off the 502 this path has always
 *      answered, so the table is no longer the pre-task vocabulary.
 *
 * The control must exit 0 WITH the criterion's cases in its output, and every mutation must exit
 * non-zero naming the case it is about; if a mutation is green, the criterion is measuring its own
 * description and not the thing the mutation broke. The second entry is why the table is a table:
 * a criterion that compared each row against the table it just read would stay green while the
 * table moved, so the row values are pinned independently in the criterion and this proves it.
 *
 * WHY A TEMP TREE AND NOT A MUTATED CHECKOUT. Editing the shipping file would make this case
 * dependent on crashing the run that is executing it, and a failure halfway would leave the tree
 * mutated. The copy is built out of the shipping files by `cpSync`, never re-typed, so there is no
 * second implementation here to drift — and because the service's whole runtime graph is the
 * `shared/asr` tree (its other imports are type-only, which the loader erases), the tree needs no
 * `node_modules` and no network.
 *
 * The subprocess lives HERE and not in the criterion: a criterion that spawns a copy of itself is
 * a criterion that can pass while the shipping code is broken.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test server/modules/voice/tests/voice-provider-dispatch-falsify.test.ts
