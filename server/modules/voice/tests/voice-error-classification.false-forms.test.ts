/**
 * The falsifying forms behind `voice-error-classification.test.ts`, plus AC7's exit codes and AC8's
 * compiler reading.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN MORE READINGS. A green criterion is evidence only if a broken
 * implementation would have made it red, and that is not something a passing run can show about
 * itself. Each case here builds a BROKEN copy of a shipping module by a one-line text mutation, runs
 * the criterion's whole reading list against it, and requires the readings it predicts to fail — by
 * name, and with the FIGURE that went wrong, so the red is attributable to a clause rather than to a
 * reading. The four mutations are the four cheap ways to satisfy this task's words while missing its
 * subject:
 *
 *   · (i) `status-only` — classify from the status alone, never reading the answer's own error code.
 *     Every code in the vocabulary still exists and the table still has thirteen rows; a `403`
 *     `AccessDenied.Unpurchased` and a `403` with no code collapse onto one answer, which is the
 *     single thing this task exists to stop. If this case passes, AC2's `matched` and AC3's
 *     `distinct400` are not measuring that the BODY decides.
 *   · (ii) `429-all-rate-limited` — short-circuit every `429` to `RATE_LIMITED` before the body is
 *     read. The rate limit is still classified, the quota codes still exist; the two quota facts
 *     behind the same number are gone. If this case passes, AC3's `distinct429` is not measuring the
 *     `429` group's width.
 *   · (iii) `table-missing-a-code` — delete one row from the code→status table. The table is still a
 *     table, the code still exists in the vocabulary, and the row that is missing is the one whose
 *     absence a reader would have to notice by eye. If this case passes, AC4's `missing` is not
 *     measuring that the table covers the vocabulary.
 *   · (iv) `table-extra-a-code` — add a row for a code the vocabulary no longer has (the deleted
 *     `UPSTREAM_ERROR`). Thirteen rows are still there and one more; a table written against the OLD
 *     vocabulary is exactly the drift this task's table is meant to have ended. If this case passes,
 *     AC4's `extra` is not measuring that the table is written against THIS vocabulary.
 *
 * EACH CASE HAS THREE PARTS, and the first is what keeps the others from being vacuous:
 *   1. the UNMUTATED copy must clear the whole list (a harness that is red for its own reasons proves
 *      nothing by going red on a mutant);
 *   2. the MUTATED copy must red every reading the case predicts, and that reading's measured value
 *      must contain the figure the mutation changes — a reading that is red for some other reason, or
 *      green while the figure is visibly wrong, is reported as a hole rather than as a success;
 *   3. some reading OUTSIDE that family must still be green, so "the whole rig broke" is not what the
 *      red means.
 *
 * WHERE THE COPIES GO, AND WHY NOT BESIDE THE MODULES. The sibling criteria in this directory put
 * their temp copies beside the modules they copy, because a copy keeps that module's relative imports
 * and only resolves in place. The copies here go to `tmp/__criterion-falsify-voice-error-classification/`
 * instead, and this is a registered deviation with two reasons rather than a preference:
 *   · AC8's drift mutant is TYPE-INVALID ON PURPOSE — that is what it measures. A type-invalid `.ts`
 *     sitting in `shared/` or `server/` while it exists reds a SIBLING criterion's `npm run typecheck`,
 *     and six files in this suite run that command concurrently. A criterion that can red another
 *     task's gate by existing has stopped being an observation of its own subject.
 *   · `tmp/` is gitignored, so the copies cannot appear in anyone's `git status --porcelain` snapshot
 *     either — including the three sibling criteria whose leftovers readings walk that output.
 * A copy in `tmp/` is one level deeper than the module it copies, so its `'./…'` imports are re-rooted
 * to `'../../shared/asr/…'` (`copyText` below) and each arm asserts that the re-rooting is the copy's
 * ONLY difference from the shipping text (`shippingOf`): a red is about the mutation, not the copy.
 *
 * WHY AC7'S EXIT CODES AND AC8'S COMPILER RUN ARE HERE. AC7 asks for the exit code of thirteen
 * existing criteria plus `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`, each printed rather than assumed, and
 * AC8 asks for a red compiler run on a drifted vocabulary. Those are SUBPROCESSES, and AC1 requires
 * the criterion file itself to start none inside a fifteen-second budget — one `npm run typecheck`
 * alone is most of that budget. This file is the task's other executable artifact, it already starts
 * subprocesses, and it is not the file AC1's budget is about. The criterion's AC8 reading therefore
 * prints `typecheck-reds-on-drift=not-measured-here` and names this file, rather than claiming a
 * measurement it did not take.
 *
 * WHY AC7 NO LONGER STARTS A SECOND VITEST FOR THE ASR CONTRACT SPEC. It used to: the entry ran
 * `npx vitest run src/shared/asr/tests/asrContractInvariants.test.ts` in a child of its own, and
 * under the fleet that child is what went red. Measured on this box (2026-09-27, one process in a
 * scope): that child peaks at 1.944 GB, while every other entry in AC7_COMMANDS is the ~0.3 GB a
 * `tsx --test` file costs — and the whole fleet (every task worker, every fan-in, every capped
 * scope) runs inside ONE `quay-fleet.slice` with MemoryMax=64G (scripts/start-drivers-scoped.sh).
 * So the extra vitest per AC7 invocation is a MULTIPLIER on that ceiling rather than a defect of any
 * one call: while the client lane was already running the very same spec (the lane's own per-file
 * record for it reads passed=true in the same log), the AC7 child was OOM-killed, `spawnSync`
 * returned `status: null`, `runCommand`'s `result.status ?? 1` reported `exit=1`, and the criterion
 * red — six such reds across two unrelated tasks' fan-ins (.quay/fan-in-suite-*.log). Re-running the
 * suite does not clear it either: the criterion reds on a clean tree under the fleet, which is why
 * this is a fix task and not a re-dispatch.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACES IT, AND WHAT STILL HOLDS. The spec's EXECUTION was never AC7's to carry: the client
 * lane is the repository-level criterion that collects `src/**\/*.test.ts{,x}` (vitest.config.ts's
 * `include`) and whose per-file `passed=false` reds the suite (scripts/test.sh's client phase). AC7
 * now asks that lane's resolver to ENUMERATE the spec's cases — `vitest list <path>`, which loads the
 * module graph but forks no worker and runs no test body: measured 0.281 GB anon / 0.366 GB peak
 * against the 1.819 GB anon / 1.944 GB peak it replaces, a 6.5x anon cut, so it cannot contribute to
 * the oversubscription the red came from. It asks for the full listing rather than `--filesOnly`
 * (0.091 GB) because the listing is the stronger falsifiable reading: the lines it prints name the
 * spec's own cases as vitest resolved them, so "collected" is a claim about a spec with cases in it
 * rather than about a path string this file could have copied. Renaming the spec out of the lane's
 * globs, narrowing `include` until it no longer collects the spec, and emptying the spec of cases are
 * all reds.
 *
 * AND IT IS NOT AN ECHO OF ITS OWN QUESTION. `vitest list <path>` EXITS 0 WITH NO OUTPUT for a path
 * the lane does not collect, so an exit-code-only reading here would be a vacuous pass and the case
 * below does not take one. It asks `vitest list` about such a path and requires SILENCE: no case
 * line, no path echoed. That arm is what makes the marker on the collected path a measurement of the
 * lane's `include` set instead of a command repeating the argument it was handed — the same refusal
 * of a vacuous pass that the exit-code loop makes one level up.
 *
 * AC8'S DRIFT READING RUNS THE PROJECT'S OWN OPTIONS, NOT THE PROJECT'S OWN COMMAND. The mutant copy's
 * per-arm `tsconfig` is `{"extends": "../../server/tsconfig.json", "include": ["./<arm>.ts"]}`, so the
 * compiler options, `lib`, `types`, `moduleResolution` and `strict` are `server/tsconfig.json`'s own
 * and only the file list differs; the unmutated arm is compiled the same way first, so a mutant red
 * cannot be a red produced by the flag set. What is NOT done is drifting the shipping registry in
 * place and running `npm run typecheck`: that would put a type-invalid shipping file in front of the
 * sibling criteria's concurrent typecheck for the duration, which is the hazard the placement above
 * exists to avoid. The pair — the shipping tree green under the real `npm run typecheck` (AC7's
 * reading) and the drift red under the project's own options (this one) — is what AC8 asks for.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test server/modules/voice/tests/voice-error-classification.false-forms.test.ts
