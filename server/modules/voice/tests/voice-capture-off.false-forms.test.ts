/**
 * The falsifying forms behind `voice-capture-off.test.ts`, plus the exit-code half of AC6.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN MORE READINGS. A green criterion is evidence only if a broken
 * implementation would have made it red, and that claim is not something a passing run can show
 * about itself. So each case here builds a BROKEN copy of a shipping module by a one-line text
 * mutation, runs the whole reading list against it, and requires the readings it predicts to fail.
 * The two mutations are the two cheap ways to satisfy this task's words while missing its subject:
 *
 *   · `gate-permanently-open` — record whenever a port exists. Every sentence about "the mode
 *     decides" is still literally implemented (there IS a mode, the port carries it, the audio write
 *     still checks for `audio`), and an `off` deployment records attempt rows. If this case passes,
 *     AC2's byte-equality readings are not measuring the gate.
 *   · `invalid-treated-as-text` — treat a value nobody defined as `text`. The resolver keeps its
 *     three named modes and its warning, and the fail-CLOSED decision is gone: a deployment that
 *     misspells the mode records the thing it meant to keep out of the log. If this case passes,
 *     AC4's start-up readings are not measuring which mode the process came up in.
 *
 * EACH CASE HAS THREE PARTS, and the first is what keeps the other two from being vacuous:
 *   1. the UNMUTATED copy must clear the whole list (a harness that is red for its own reasons
 *      proves nothing by going red on a mutant);
 *   2. the MUTATED copy must red at least one reading in the predicted family, and the red reading
 *      is printed by name so the failure is attributable;
 *   3. some reading OUTSIDE that family must still be green, so "the whole rig broke" is not what
 *      the red means.
 *
 * THE COPIES LIVE IN THE SAME TREE as the files they copy (`server/modules/voice/`), because a
 * module's imports are relative — `../../../shared/asr/asrRegistry.js` — and a copy in the OS temp
 * directory would not resolve them. Each copy gets its OWN path, because ESM caches a module by URL:
 * a mutant written over the base copy's path would import the already-evaluated base module and the
 * run would measure nothing. A copy of the SERVICE module still imports the SHIPPING capture module,
 * which is exactly what makes the two cases independent — each mutation is the only difference.
 * THAT DIRECTORY IS SHARED: the sibling criteria that build temp copies (`voice-capture-text`,
 * `voice-dashscope-settings`) write the same `__criterion-falsify-` prefix there and the suite runs
 * them concurrently, so the tree-half reading is scoped to this process's own copies — the AC7 case's
 * doc comment says why.
 *
 * WHY AC6'S EXIT CODES ARE HERE. AC6 asks for the exit code of four existing criteria plus
 * `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`, each printed rather than assumed. Those are SUBPROCESSES,
 * and AC1 requires the criterion file itself to start none inside a fifteen-second budget — one
 * `npm run typecheck` alone is most of that budget. This file is the task's other executable
 * artifact, it already starts `git`, and it is not the file the target-side gate runs. The in-process
 * half of AC6 (the `off` attempt line gains no field) is where the lines are, in the criterion file.

 * snapshot-vs-sample comparison report "changed" on a tree whose final state was empty. That is a
 * cross-PROCESS artifact, not residue, so the comparison forgives exactly that and nothing else:
 *
 *   · THIS run's own copies stay an unconditional red (`own-temp-copies`), so the property AC7 names
 *     — no temp copy of this run survives — is asserted at full strength, and more precisely than
 *     before (the old reading reported a sibling's copies as if they were this run's);
 *   · a difference is forgiven ONLY when every line in it is a temp copy belonging to another pid.
 *     Any other added, removed or modified path — a copy of this run's, a stray file, a touched
 *     tracked file — keeps the red, and the failure prints both sides of the delta;
 *   · a foreign copy present in BOTH snapshots contributes no difference at all and needs no
 *     forgiveness.
