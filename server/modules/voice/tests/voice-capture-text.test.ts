/**
 * The `text` payload: what one attempt ACTUALLY used, sent and got back, on the row it records.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS THE CRITERION FOR. `voice-capture-off.test.ts` reads the mode resolution, the
 * start-up line, the gate and the row's EXISTENCE. It deliberately does not read the row's CONTENTS,
 * and until this criterion those contents were the attempt's own four fields and nothing else — a
 * deployment could not answer "which model did it actually use", "which host answered", "what did the
 * upstream actually say", "which of the six ways did this attempt end", or "what did we hand back"
 * from its own log. Every reading here is about one of those, and every one of them is a reading
 * about the ROW: the row is the only artifact this task delivers.
 *
 * THE SUBJECT IS THE RAW RETURN, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS READ RATHER THAN RECONSTRUCTED. The upstream's
 * answer is the one thing on this path nothing but the transport can produce, so the criterion's
 * stand-in transport answers with a body it also hands to the readings — and the reading is that the
 * row carries THAT string, verbatim, rather than the text the attempt's caller finally got. Those two
 * differ exactly where it matters (`empty-instruction` and `not-an-envelope` below: the caller got a
 * transcription, or nothing, and the upstream said something else entirely), so a row built from the
 * caller's value would pass a reading that only asked "is there a body" and fail this one.
 *
 * HOW IT IS DRIVEN. Eight attempts through ONE shipping service and ONE stand-in transport, in TWO
 * arms that differ only in the mode the port was resolved to: `text` (the shipping port constructor,
 * eight capture rows) and `off` (the same eight attempts, no rows at all). Both arms are driven in
 * the same process against the same harness, so `off.captureLines=0` beside `text.captureLines=8` is
 * a measured pair rather than two runs a reader has to line up. Nothing here reaches a network, starts
 * a process or opens a socket: the transport is the injected port every attempt already goes through,
 * and the log is an array the criterion owns.
 *
 * THE EIGHT ATTEMPTS ARE THE SIX BRANCHES PLUS THE TWO SIDES OF THE CUT. `written`,
 * `upstream-failure` and `preflight-refused` are the three an attempt can end as when the transport
 * is or is not reached; `verbatim-fallback`, `no-speech` and `envelope-error` are the three an answer
 * can end as when it is reached and unusable. `over-limit` and `at-limit` are the same success at
 * 70000 bytes and at exactly the limit, which is what makes the truncation reading two-ended: a
 * mutation that never truncates and one that always flags must both go red, and one case alone cannot
 * tell those apart from a correct implementation.
 *
 * FALSIFYING FORMS LIVE IN `voice-capture-text.false-forms.test.ts`, and the readings are collected
 * by one exported function so that file can run THIS list against a text-mutated copy of
 * `voice-capture.ts`. Its four cases name which reading each mutation must red; see the header there
 * for why each one is reachable at all. Registering the readings as `node:test` cases is guarded by
 * `IS_ENTRY`, so importing this file registers nothing.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT COVER (registered in the `AC12 registration` reading rather than left to a
 * reader to notice): the audio mode and its file write, a secrets criterion over the stored
 * credential, capture-failure isolation, and any real-process reading. The write-audio path is
 * exercised ONLY as a positive control, so that the zero this criterion measures is a measured zero;
 * the shipping file write itself is another task's delivery.
