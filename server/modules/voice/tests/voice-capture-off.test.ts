/**
 * `VOICE_CAPTURE`'s mode gate: what `off` IS, and what it must not do (AC-143).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. `VOICE_CAPTURE` selects one of three recording modes at start-up, and the
 * two recording modes are a privacy decision rather than a debugging detail: an attempt's structured
 * line is one thing, and a row — or an uploaded recording — kept beside it is another. Two failures
 * are worth a criterion, and both are cheap to make accidentally:
 *
 *   1. a deployment that NEVER SET THE VARIABLE, or misspelled it, records anyway — the fail-open
 *      shape, where the mode is read as "on unless something says otherwise";
 *   2. a seam that changes what an `off` deployment already logs today — an extra line, an added
 *      field, a directory created beside the database.
 *
 * The readings are measurements of four questions, all taken through the SHIPPING modules, with an
 * injected `fetchBackend` and a frozen clock (nothing here touches the network, and `latencyMs` is a
 * constant so the byte-for-byte comparison is about the seam rather than about timing):
 *
 *   · AC2 — are the three `off`-reading cases BYTE-IDENTICAL to a baseline service built with NO
 *     capture port at all? Compared line by line, because "the log contains no capture row" is blind
 *     to "the log gained a different line";
 *   · AC3 — do those cases touch the filesystem? The injected write-audio port REALLY writes when it
 *     is reached, and two audio control arms reach it in the same run, so the zero is a measured
 *     zero rather than a port that could not have written;
 *   · AC4 — which mode does the process say it came up in, does an unrecognised value earn exactly
 *     one warning naming it and read as `off`, and does the composition root read the variable once
 *     and call the module's own start-up function;
 *   · AC5 — is the zero not an empty implementation? The same input in `text` mode must produce
 *     exactly two capture rows, each carrying the same `captureId` as the attempt line above it;
 *   · AC8 — the scope this criterion does NOT cover is printed beside the parts of the claim that
 *     ARE measurable (the row's field set, the absent audio sink in the shipping composition root,
 *     the frozen clock visible in every line, and the door list AC1 reads too), so the registration
 *     is a reading a reader can check rather than a paragraph a reader can only trust.
 *
 * HOW IT IS STRUCTURED, and why this matters to a reader of a red: the readings live in one exported
 * function so that the FALSIFYING file (`voice-capture-off.false-forms.test.ts`) can run this very
 * list against a text-mutated copy of `voice.service.ts` or `voice-capture.ts` and require the
 * readings it predicts to go red. Registering them as `node:test` cases is guarded by `IS_ENTRY`, so
 * importing this file registers nothing and the falsify run measures only what it asked for.
 *
 * AC6's OTHER HALF LIVES IN THE FALSIFYING FILE, and the split is forced by AC1's own budget: the
 * four existing criteria plus `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` are SUBPROCESSES, and AC1
 * requires THIS file to start none. Its `AC1 scope` reading reports that mechanically by reading
 * this file's own module specifiers. AC6's in-process half — the `off` attempt line gains no field —
 * is measured here, where the lines already are.
