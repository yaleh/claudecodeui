/**
 * The failure envelope of the shipping transcription route: what a failed `POST /api/voice/transcribe`
 * actually answers with (AC-150).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. A user whose recording fails is shown a sentence, and the sentence is chosen
 * from the failure's `code`. Before this task the route published a code only for the three refusals
 * that happen *before* the upstream is touched (an unaccepted container, an oversized upload, an
 * address a provider's own rule refuses); every failure the recogniser produced — a rejected key, the
 * service's own rate limit, a model the account has not enabled, an answer with no speech in it, a
 * transport that never connected — arrived as a message and a status number. `422` and `502` are each
 * several different remedies, so a client asked to write the sentence had nothing to pick with. Two
 * properties are therefore worth a criterion, and both are cheap to lose again:
 *
 *   1. every failure of the transcription path names a vocabulary member, and the upstream's own code
 *      string travels beside it when the upstream named one;
 *   2. the wire carries nothing else — not the caller's key, not the `Bearer` form of it, and none of
 *      the upstream's answer text beyond the code string itself.
 *
 * The readings are measurements of four questions, all taken through the SHIPPING modules
 * (`createVoiceRouter` + `createVoiceService`, assembled the way `voice.module.ts` assembles them),
 * with an injected offline `fetchBackend`, a stand-in `parseAudioUpload` and no socket or port:
 *
 *   · AC2 — do all four kinds of failure (pre-check, upstream, no-speech, unreachable) answer with
 *     `error` AND a code that is a member of the shipping vocabulary?
 *   · AC3 — is `upstreamCode`, when present, shaped like a code, bounded in length, and a slice of the
 *     body the upstream actually sent — and absent, not invented, when the upstream named nothing, when
 *     nothing was ever sent, and when the only candidate is too long to be one?
 *   · AC4 — is the zero on the leak side a zero measured against positive controls (the key really is
 *     on the upstream request, the sentinel really is in the upstream answer)?
 *   · AC7 — is the vocabulary read off the shipping table rather than copied into this file?
 *
 * HOW IT IS STRUCTURED, and why that matters to a reader of a red: the readings live in one exported
 * function so that the FALSIFYING file (`voice-error-contract.false-forms.test.ts`) can run this very
 * list against a text-mutated copy of `voice.service.ts` and require the readings it predicts to go
 * red. Registering them as `node:test` cases is guarded by `IS_ENTRY`, so importing this file
 * registers nothing and the falsify run measures only what it asked for.
 *
 * AC5's falsifying forms and AC6's exit codes live in that other file, and the split is forced by AC1's
 * own budget: six `npx tsx --test` subprocesses plus `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` are most of
 * this criterion's fifteen seconds, and AC1 requires THIS file to start none.
