/**
 * The falsifying forms behind `voice-capture-text.test.ts`, plus the exit-code half of AC10.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN MORE READINGS. A green criterion is evidence only if a broken
 * implementation would have made it red, and that claim is not something a passing run can show about
 * itself. So each case here builds a BROKEN copy of a shipping module by a one-line text mutation,
 * runs the whole reading list against it, and requires the readings it predicts to fail — by name, and
 * with the FIGURE that went wrong, so the red is attributable to a clause rather than to a reading.
 * The four mutations are the four cheap ways to satisfy this task's words while missing its subject:
 *
 *   · (i) `upstream-body-replaced-by-final-text` — record the text the caller finally got instead of
 *     the answer that came back. Every word about "the upstream raw return" is still implemented (the
 *     row has an `upstream` object, with a status and a body), and the row is no longer a copy of what
 *     the upstream said. If this case passes, AC3's `rawVerbatim` is not measuring the raw return.
 *   · (ii) `failure-row-dropped` — build a row only for attempts that ended well. The construction
 *     point still exists and every field is still there; the two failures this task is FOR leave no
 *     trace at all. If this case passes, AC4's `failRow` is not measuring that the refused attempt was
 *     recorded.
 *   · (iii-a) `no-truncation` — take the verbatim branch unconditionally, so nothing is ever cut. The
 *     limit constant is still exported and still compared; it just no longer decides anything. If this
 *     case passes, AC7's `over.bodyBytes`/`over.flag` are not measuring the cut.
 *   · (iii-b) `truncated-always-true` — mark every answer as cut. The cut still happens where it
 *     should; the marker no longer distinguishes a cut body from a whole one, so a reader cannot tell
 *     a prefix from the answer. If this case passes, AC3's `truncatedAbsent` and AC7's
 *     `atLimit.flagAbsent` are not measuring the marker's ABSENCE.
 *
 * EACH CASE HAS THREE PARTS, and the first is what keeps the other two from being vacuous:
 *   1. the UNMUTATED copy must clear the whole list (a harness that is red for its own reasons proves
 *      nothing by going red on a mutant);
 *   2. the MUTATED copy must red every reading the case predicts, and that reading's measured value
 *      must contain the figure the mutation changes — a reading that is red for some other reason, or
 *      green while the figure is visibly wrong, is reported as a hole rather than as a success;
 *   3. some reading OUTSIDE that family must still be green, so "the whole rig broke" is not what the
 *      red means.
 *
 * WHERE THE COPIES GO, AND WHY NOT BESIDE THIS FILE. A copy of a module keeps that module's relative
 * imports (`../../../shared/asr/…`), so a copy in this file's directory would not resolve them; the
 * copies therefore live beside the modules they copy, under `server/modules/voice/`, which is the same
 * tree and the only place a copy of these modules resolves at all. Each copy gets its OWN path,
 * because ESM caches a module by URL: a mutant written over the base copy's path would import the
 * already-evaluated base module and the run would measure nothing. A copy of the CAPTURE module is
 * still imported by the SHIPPING service, and the criterion drives the shipping service, so the
 * mutation is the only difference in each arm. THAT DIRECTORY IS SHARED: the sibling criteria that
 * build temp copies (`voice-capture-off`, `voice-dashscope-settings`) write the same
 * `__criterion-falsify-` prefix there and the suite runs them concurrently, so the tree-half reading
 * is scoped to this process's own copies — the AC11 case's doc comment says why.
 *
 * WHY AC10'S EXIT CODES ARE HERE. AC10 asks for the exit code of six existing criteria plus
 * `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`, each printed rather than assumed. Those are SUBPROCESSES,
 * and AC1 requires the criterion file itself to start none inside a fifteen-second budget — one
 * `npm run typecheck` alone is most of that budget. This file is the task's other executable artifact,
 * it already starts `git`, and it is not the file AC1's budget is about.

 * WHY THE READING IS SCOPED BY PID. The copies cannot live in the OS temp directory (their relative

 * `voice-capture-off` and `voice-dashscope-settings` build their own `__criterion-falsify-*` copies
 * in the SAME directory, and the suite runs four files at a time. So a sibling's copies are untracked
 * lines in this file's tree through no act of this file's, and a sibling that is still holding them
 * when this file STARTS has finished and cleaned up by the time this reading runs — which made the
 * snapshot-vs-sample comparison report "changed" on a tree whose final state was empty. That is a
 * cross-PROCESS artifact, not residue, so the comparison forgives exactly that and nothing else:
 *
 *   · THIS run's own copies stay an unconditional red (`own-temp-copies`), so the property AC11 names
 *     — no temp copy of this run survives — is asserted at full strength, and more precisely than
 *     before (the old reading reported a sibling's copies as if they were this run's);
 *   · a difference is forgiven ONLY when every line in it is a temp copy belonging to another pid.
 *     Any other added, removed or modified path — a copy of this run's, a stray file, a touched
 *     tracked file — keeps the red, and the failure prints both sides of the delta;
 *   · a foreign copy present in BOTH snapshots contributes no difference at all and needs no
 *     forgiveness.
 *
 * `temp-copies-any` and `raw-unchanged` are printed beside the scoped verdict, so what was excluded
 * is visible in the reading rather than implied by it.
