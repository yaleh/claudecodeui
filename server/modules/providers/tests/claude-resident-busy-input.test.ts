/**
 * AC-163 criterion — a message sent while a resident session is busy.
 *
 * A resident host holds one CLI across turns, and the CLI's own input queue is
 * what makes the mode usable: a message typed while a turn is running must be
 * taken by the process, run afterwards as a turn of its own, and be withdrawable
 * until the process starts on it. The three behaviours the CLI already has
 * (measured on the real binary — `docs/proposals/claude-resident-sessions-experiments.md`
 * §9) are:
 *
 * 1. A busy message is not refused. It is written into the process's stdin
 *    immediately, under the `later` tier, and it is the CLI — not the server —
 *    that holds it until the turn in flight ends.
 * 2. It is not merged into the turn in flight either: the CLI runs it as a turn
 *    of its own afterwards. The write is still earlier than the current turn's
 *    `result`, which is exactly what "written into the queue, not into the
 *    turn" means as a measurement.
 * 3. A message still in the queue can be taken back. The withdrawal is judged by
 *    the queue's own account of it — a `command_lifecycle state=cancelled` event
 *    — and never by a control response, because `cancel_async_message` is
 *    answered by none at any of the three timings (still queued, already
 *    dequeued, uuid that never existed).
 *
 * The scenario below drives all three on one real resident process (a real
 * `claude` binary, an Anthropic-compatible endpoint standing in for the model,
 * a temporary `DATABASE_PATH`) through the real `chat.send` path. The mock
 * *holds* its answers, which is the only way to have a turn be in flight while
 * the criterion is looking at it:
 *
 * - Round one is a real `chat.send` that asks for a background `Bash` call, so
 *   the process has work running behind it and can later open a turn of its own.
 *   Its agent request is held, so leg 1's busy send lands while a user round is
 *   genuinely running.
 * - Leg 2's busy send lands while the *unattended* turn — the one the process
 *   opened for itself when that background work finished — is running.
 * - A third message is withdrawn while it is still queued (its text must appear
 *   in no turn's request at all), and the first message is withdrawn after the
 *   process has already started it (which must be reported as such, with no
 *   cancelled event and no effect on the process).
 *
 * Red lines:
 * - The process budget guard below kills the whole process with `exit 3` rather
 *   than failing one case, so a resident lifecycle that hangs is a budget kill
 *   with its own reading, as in the sibling resident criteria.
 * - Every reading is taken before anything is asserted, so a red lands on the
 *   reading that is wrong rather than on a timeout or on an earlier leg.
 * - The five fake forms this criterion is graded against each have an arm below
 *   that drives the *same* named assertion the real leg drives, so an assertion
 *   with a hole would pass the mutant and the arm would report it.
 * - Turn boundaries and turn identity are read from the request bodies'
 *   **byte size** (`bytes > 10KB`), never from a request's ordinal and never from
 *   whether a body carries user text: every turn first sends a ~2KB preflight
 *   that would be indistinguishable from a real turn by either of those.
