/**
 * AC-164 criterion — the address a resident Claude process answers to, and
 * whether a copy of that address is enough to reach the process.
 *
 * A resident host holds one CLI across turns, and every CLI process registers a
 * name for itself when it starts: other sessions on the machine can address it
 * by that name. Claude Code picks that name; **CloudCLI does not**. It used to
 * (`--name <slug>-<id6>`, proposal §12), and that is the design this criterion
 * was rewritten for: an app-invented name outranked the session's own `ai-title`
 * and grew a new suffix on every restart. The app now launches the process with
 * no name at all and *reads* the name Claude Code derived, out of the process's
 * own registration (`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`).
 *
 * Three things are measured here, on real processes (this criterion spawns the
 * real `claude` binary against an Anthropic-compatible mock endpoint):
 *
 * 1. The address is *the process's own*. The host snapshot's `peerName` has to
 *    be the `name` in that process's registration file, read here by this
 *    criterion directly off disk, and the registration's `nameSource` has to be
 *    `derived` — the CLI's own derivation — rather than `user`, which is what a
 *    name handed to the process through `--name` reads as.
 * 2. The app *injects nothing*. The process's transcript must hold no
 *    `agent-name` and no `custom-title` entry: those are the two entries a
 *    `--name` writes (as a pair, with the same value), and a transcript that
 *    carries one is the app having named the session after all.
 * 3. The address *survives a rename*. Renaming the session moves the name a user
 *    sees, and the address must not move with it: a process that answered to
 *    `archguard-85` before a rename has to answer to it after, or every copy of
 *    the address a peer is holding has been invalidated by an app-side edit.
 *    Read as `pid` and registration `name` before and after.
 *
 * The restatement rule is gone with the rule. What replaces it is the witness:
 * the expected address is the registration file's own `name`, read by this file
 * rather than through the driver's reader, so "the driver published what the
 * registry says" is a claim about two independent reads and not about a function
 * agreeing with itself.
 *
 * Three living hosts carry the readings:
 * - A and B are two resident sessions in one database. A is the sender, B the
 *   addressee.
 * - C is the control arm and is launched with *no* `sessionSummary`. Under the
 *   old rule its address was uncomputable and read as `null`; under this one a
 *   session's address does not depend on any title the app holds, so C must
 *   publish the name its own process registered while having been told nothing.
 *   That is what makes the pair falsifiable inside one unmutated run: a driver
 *   that went back to computing an address from the title would publish nothing
 *   for C, and a driver that published a name it made up would disagree with C's
 *   registration file.
 *
 * The delivery itself is real: the mock scripts A's turn into a `SendMessage`
 * tool call whose `to` is the address this criterion read from
 * `GET /api/session-hosts` — the same REST projection a client would read — and
 * B, being a real Claude process registered under that name, opens a turn of its
 * own for the arriving message. That turn is the measured outcome: a run with
 * `source=unattended`, a notification whose trigger names the cross-session
 * arrival rather than an unexplained turn, and frames a later subscriber can
 * replay. This is the reading the task record calls load-bearing: it is the one
 * thing a *derived* address had never been shown to do, and the whole reason
 * dropping the app's own name is not a loss of addressability.
 *
 * Red lines:
 * - The process budget guard below kills the whole process with `exit 3` rather
 *   than failing one case, so a lifecycle that hangs is a budget kill with its
 *   own reading, as in the sibling `claude-resident-unattended-turn` criterion.
 * - Every reading is printed before anything is asserted, and the assertions
 *   start with the registration-versus-snapshot agreement for A and B. The
 *   graded false form (the driver computes an address of its own and hands it to
 *   the process) reds on *this* reading, because the name published and the name
 *   the process registered are then two different strings — and it reds on the
 *   transcript reading too, since a name handed over is a name written down.
 * - The trigger is read off the arrival as the CLI states it on the turn's own
 *   `result`. The `Stop` hook's task list is the reading for every other reason a
 *   resident process opens a turn, and it cannot see a peer message at all: a
 *   turn opened that way holds nothing, which is why it is the `result` that has
 *   to carry the fact.
