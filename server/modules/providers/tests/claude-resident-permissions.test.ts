/**
 * AC-168 criterion — the resident permission surface.
 *
 * A resident Claude process is one CLI held across turns under
 * `bypassPermissions`. Bypass is the right launch mode (nobody is there to
 * approve a tool), but it is not the same as "nothing ever asks a person": the
 * CLI still refers the *human-facing* requests — `AskUserQuestion`,
 * `ExitPlanMode`, an MCP elicitation, a `request_user_dialog` — to the host. A
 * host that installed no callback for those leaves the request parked on a
 * person who is not connected, which is a turn that never ends. This criterion
 * measures the three entries that close that hole, on the production driver with
 * a scripted process stream:
 *
 *   (1) the SDK options one resident launch is built with: `permissionMode`
 *       `'bypassPermissions'` *and* `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions` `true`
 *       (the SDK requires both together), with all three entries installed.
 *   (2) switching the mode mid-life goes through `query.setPermissionMode` on
 *       the *running* process: same host id, same pid, one spawn.
 *   (3) with nobody connected and no user round in flight, all three entries
 *       answer by themselves — `canUseTool` denies, `onElicitation` cancels,
 *       `onUserDialog` cancels — each inside a short budget, each leaving a
 *       notification behind, and none of them entering the client wait.
 *   (4) with a browser connected, the same three take the *existing*
 *       request-frame path: a `permission_request` frame on the run's writer, an
 *       entry in the runtime's own pending list, and the client's answer the
 *       entry returns once `resolveToolApproval` hands it over.
 *
 * What is measured, and what is taken from where:
 *
 * - The launch options are read off the object the SDK is handed: the process
 *   factory below composes the *production* `createSdkResidentProcess` and
 *   replaces only its query (`createQuery`), so the bag the criterion reads is
 *   the bag `buildResidentSdkOptions` built for that launch — not a second copy
 *   of it.
 * - The three entries are the ones that launch installed, read off that same
 *   bag. Driving them is what an SDK would do when the CLI refers a request;
 *   what the *CLI* does with a live process is E8's and E9's measurement (the
 *   readings are cited from the experiment record below rather than re-taken,
 *   because a scripted stream has no CLI to ask).
 * - The `(2)` request is E9 §9.6's own frame, transcribed verbatim below. The
 *   `(3)` request is *forged from `sdk.d.ts`* and says so in as many words: E9
 *   never reached that entry, so there is no wire sample to transcribe.
 * - `side_question` is deliberately absent: it travels host→CLI, its answer is
 *   not a refusal, and AC-168 puts it out of scope. The file's own text is read
 *   back at the end and the absence is asserted rather than claimed.
 *
 * Red lines:
 * - Every entry call is wrapped in a short budget, and a call that outlives it
 *   fails *this case* with the entry's own name. The process budget guard the
 *   sibling criteria carry is deliberately not reproduced here: AC-168 asks for
 *   an attributable red inside the budget, not a process-level kill.
 * - A host is never left behind: the last leg advances the manager's own clock
 *   past the idle ceiling and reads the close out of `snapshot()`.
