/**
 * AC-162 criterion — the turn a resident Claude process opens by itself.
 *
 * A resident host holds one CLI across turns. Nothing in the protocol makes that
 * CLI stay quiet between them: a background task it started (a `Bash` call with
 * `run_in_background`) finishing with nothing queued behind it makes the process
 * open a turn of its own, stream it, and come to rest again. The gap this
 * criterion measures is whether that turn is a *run* like any other — seq'd
 * frames buffered for replay, a terminal frame, a notification, and rows a later
 * reader can find in history — rather than text that reaches only whoever
 * happened to be connected when it happened.
 *
 * The intended behaviour is measured on one real resident host against a real
 * `claude` binary (the criterion's own process spawns it), with an
 * Anthropic-compatible endpoint standing in for the model:
 *
 * 1. Round one is a real `chat.send` turn that calls `Bash` with
 *    `run_in_background`, so the process is holding background work when its
 *    turn ends. The mock holds the *next* agent request, which is what makes the
 *    unattended turn's arrival observable while it is still in flight.
 * 2. Every browser socket is then disconnected (printed as
 *    `browserConnections=0`) and the trigger file the background command watches
 *    for is created — the process, not this criterion, is what opens the turn.
 * 3. A fresh connection subscribes with `lastSeq=0` while that turn is running,
 *    and the mock releases. Everything the new connection receives is compared
 *    against the run's own buffer and against the frames the real normalizer
 *    produced, from three independent surfaces:
 *    `frames` (what the wire delivered), `rowsDelta` (what the run recorded) and
 *    `framesFromNormalizer` (what `normalizeMessage` emitted for this turn,
 *    located by matching the run's rows against the normalizer's own output).
 * 4. The turn is then read back out of the two history surfaces — the provider
 *    transcript on disk and the REST history route — and the notification it
 *    made is reconciled against the `Stop` hook's own account of what the
 *    process was holding.
 *
 * Red lines:
 * - The process budget guard below kills the whole process with `exit 3` rather
 *   than failing one case, so a resident lifecycle that hangs is a budget kill
 *   with its own reading, as in the sibling `claude-resident-process` criterion.
 * - The fake form this criterion is graded against makes the unattended turn
 *   land through transcript sync only, opening no run. The first assertion of
 *   the replay leg (`replayed > 0`) is what has to red then; every reading
 *   before it is taken without asserting, so the redness lands on the replay
 *   reading rather than on a timeout or on an earlier leg.
 * - The trigger is reconciled from the `Stop` hook's own task list. This file
 *   never reads the message-level `origin` a transcript row can carry, so the
 *   word appears below only in comments (the criterion prints
 *   `grep -c "origin" <this file>` with the code hits asserted to be zero).
