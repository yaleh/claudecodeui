/**
 * Resident session cgroup scoping.
 *
 * A resident session is not one process: it is the CLI plus its MCP servers (and, when the CLI is
 * launched through an npm shim, a wrapper process on top), which on this host adds up to roughly
 * a gigabyte per idle session. The server used to spawn all of them into its own cgroup, where
 * `memory.max` is `max`, so a single runaway session — or one MCP it launched — was enough for the
 * kernel to reap the whole unit, server included. This module puts every session in its own
 * transient systemd scope with a hard `MemoryMax`, which confines that kill to the session.
 *
 * Two caps, both from configuration. The per-session cap is `MemoryMax` on the scope, and it is the
 * one that decides *whether* a runaway session dies. The second is a cap on the whole
 * {@link DEFAULT_RESIDENT_SLICE_NAME} slice the scopes are placed in — the level at which "the
 * resident processes together" is expressible — and it is what keeps the kernel choosing its
 * victim from among the residents rather than from the host. Both come from the environment
 * (`CLAUDE_SESSION_MEMORY_MAX`, `CLAUDE_RESIDENT_SLICE_MEMORY_MAX`) and both are injectable, so a
 * criterion can pin the mechanism without waiting for a production soak to pick the numbers.
 *
 * Provider neutral. Nothing here is about Claude beyond the file's history: the entry points are
 * named for the resident scope they create ({@link createResidentScopeSpawn} and the lifecycle
 * beside it), the slice name and the unit prefix are configuration, and a provider that owns a
 * resident process can use the same wrapper. The pre-promotion `claude*` names remain exported as
 * aliases so the runtime's wiring and the previous criterion keep their byte-identical contract.
 *
 * `systemd-run --user --scope` registers a transient scope and then `exec`s the target command in
 * the same PID, so stdio, PID and exit status are unchanged; `scripts/with-memory-cap.sh` already
 * relies on that property for test scopes.
 *
 * Environments without a usable systemd user manager (macOS, CI containers) must keep today's
 * behaviour byte for byte: {@link createResidentScopeSpawn} then returns `undefined` and the
 * caller does not install the spawn hook at all.
 *
 * Consumers:
 * - `claude-runtime.provider.js`'s `mapCliOptionsToSDK` installs the SDK `spawnClaudeCodeProcess`
 *   hook returned by {@link createResidentScopeSpawn}.
 * - `server/index.ts` starts up by sweeping orphaned scopes and shuts down by stopping the scopes
 *   this server owns; both calls arrive through `server/modules/providers/index.ts`.
 * - `server/modules/providers/tests/claude-session-scope.test.ts` drives the generated argv, the
 *   degradation path, the scope lifecycle and the OOM attribution.
 * - `server/modules/session-hosts/tests/process-containment.test.ts` drives the slice cap and
 *   {@link detectResidentScopeOomKill}, and lands the OOM fact as a host snapshot reading.

// --------------------------- PRE-PROMOTION NAMES ------------
/**
 * The `claude*` names this module exported before it was promoted to provider neutrality, kept as
 * aliases so consumers written against the old surface keep working byte for byte.
 *
 * Two kinds of consumer pin them: `claude-runtime.provider.js` and `server/index.ts` import them
 * through the providers barrel, and the previous criterion
 * (`providers/tests/claude-session-scope.test.ts`) asserts against them — including the generated
 * argv and the literal unit-name shape — so the contract is not just a name but a reading. Nothing
 * new should be written against these; a new provider uses the neutral names above.
