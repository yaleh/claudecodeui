/**
 * The Turn Tracker: reduces Claude's raw SDK frame stream into the real phase of
 * a session's turn.
 *
 * The normalizer that turns SDK frames into transcript rows is lossy for this
 * question on purpose — `system/thinking_tokens` normalizes to nothing, a
 * `compact_boundary` becomes an ordinary text row, and a partial
 * `content_block_delta` becomes a transient `stream_delta`. So the only seam
 * that sees all of them at once is the raw message the run loop hands the
 * normalizer (the `transformedMessage` argument of `forwardNormalizedFrames`),
 * which is what this reducer consumes.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and are what the criterion pins:
 *
 *  - **Phase comes from a signal, never from elapsed time.** There is no clock
 *    in this file: `toolDurationMs` stays `null` unless a frame actually carries
 *    an elapsed time, because a spinner whose number is invented locally keeps
 *    ticking after the server is gone.
 *  - **A tool ends when its own `tool_result` arrives**, not when the next
 *    assistant message does. The `tool_use` block's `id` is remembered and only
 *    the `tool_result` carrying the matching `tool_use_id` moves the turn off
 *    `tool`.
 *
 * State is per tracker instance and keyed by session id, so two sessions fed
 * interleaved frames cannot read each other's phase. A module-level singleton
 * would pass every single-session test and fail exactly the cross-talk one.
 *
 * **The key is the app session id, and every edge must agree on it.** A caller
 * that observes under one id space and reads under another gets a fresh `idle`
 * record on every read (`getTurn` answers `idle` for an unknown key) — a turn
 * that is genuinely running would be reported as not running, with no error. On
 * the real run loop the provider-native id the SDK reports is *not* the id the
 * activity frames read back under, so the forwarder feeds this reducer the app
 * session id explicitly (`forwardNormalizedFrames`'s `turnSessionId`); see that
 * seam for the two ids and why they differ.
 */

/**
 * The phase of a session's turn, each value named for the signal that produces
 * it. `idle` is the absence of a turn (before the first frame, or after the
 * turn's `result`).
 *
 * - `thinking`  — a `system/thinking_tokens` estimate arrived.
 * - `writing`   — a text `content_block_delta` (the normalizer's `stream_delta`)
 *                 is in flight.
 * - `tool`      — a `tool_use` block was emitted and its paired `tool_result`
 *                 has not arrived.
 * - `awaitingPermission` — a `permission_request` is outstanding.
