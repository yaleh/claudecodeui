/**
 * Claude's per-run host driver: the process-lifetime half of the Claude runtime,
 * behind `IProvider.hostDriver`, so the session-host layer decides when a per-run
 * process starts and when it ends.
 *
 * ## What this driver owns
 *
 * One `per-run` host is one SDK query. `submit` builds the turn's prompt messages
 * through the runtime's own builder, wraps them in the runtime's held prompt
 * stream, calls the injected query factory and consumes the resulting stream.
 * Holding that stream open is what keeps the CLI alive after a turn's `result`
 * (the CLI reads stdin EOF as print wind-down), and ending it is what lets the
 * process go.
 *
 * ## What it reports, and what it never decides
 *
 * The driver does not decide when a host closes. It reports *reasons to hold* —
 * leases — through the sink `startHost` handed it, and the manager recomputes
 * state from those leases:
 *
 *  - `submit` reports the `turn` lease; the turn's own `result` drops it.
 *  - A message that the runtime's exported `startsBackgroundWork` scores as
 *    starting work outliving the turn reports `background-task` — or `monitor`,
 *    the kind named after the watching tool. A later `result` while that lease is
 *    held is that work reporting back: the lease is dropped, which is what lets
 *    the manager close the host under `released`, and the completion is notified
 *    once per hold.
 *  - Every close arrives as `closeHost(host, reason)`, the manager relaying a
 *    decision it has already made; the driver ends the held input in response.
 *    There is deliberately no supersede logic in here: a new turn on a bound
 *    session reaches the manager as a bind request, and the manager's
 *    `supersedeOnNewTurn` policy closes the old host under `superseded` before
 *    the replacement starts. See `run` for the entry that makes that order the
 *    only one reachable.
 *
 * ## What it does not own
 *
 * Frames. `HostTurnInput` carries the command and its options and no writer, so
 * the client-visible frames of a run are still produced by the runtime's own
 * `run`, which is what the application dispatch calls today; wiring this driver
 * into that dispatch path (and with it frame emission) is the mode/turn
 * integration's job, not this facet's.
 *
 * Consumed by `ClaudeProvider`, which mounts it as `IProvider.hostDriver`, and by
 * the criterion in `tests/claude-host-per-run.test.ts`, which drives it with a
 * scripted query stream, an injected clock and an injected query factory.
