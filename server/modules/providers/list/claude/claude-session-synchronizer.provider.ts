   *   belongs with: inside a rewrite the pair goes out together, but a rename
   *   after the fact appends a lone `custom-title` at the end of the file. Its
   *   position says nothing, so the ladder — not the order the entries appear
   *   in — has to decide which of the two is the name.
   *
   * Reading it costs two bounded windows rather than the file: the tail, where
   * the rewritten titles live, and — only when the tail holds none — the head,

   * with the file, so a transcript of hundreds of megabytes is read for the
