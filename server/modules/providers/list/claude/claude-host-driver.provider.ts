/**
 * Claude's resident host driver: one CLI process held across turns, behind
 * `IProvider.hostDriver`, which is what makes `lifecycle_mode = 'resident'` a
 * process the user keeps rather than one they restart on every message.
 *
 * ## What one resident host is
 *
 * One SDK query whose prompt iterable never finishes. `submit` does not build a
 * query — it writes the turn's messages into the input queue the process has
 * been reading since it started, which is the whole of "the pid does not
 * change": a second turn is more stdin on the stream that has been open all
 * along. The queue is closed only when the host is, and closing it is stdin EOF,
 * which is the CLI's own graceful exit path. `closeHost` is that and nothing
 * else; the query's own `close` is a backstop for a CLI that does not take the
 * hint (see `CLAUDE_RESIDENT_EXIT_GRACE_MS`).
 *
 * ## Turn boundaries
 *
 * A turn ends at its `result`, exactly as the runtime's own read loop reads it
 * (`claude-runtime.provider.js`), and each round submitted expects one —
 * including an interrupted round, which is why the runtime checks its abort flag
 * at `result` time rather than at the interrupt. So rounds are a FIFO: `submit`
 * appends, a `result` shifts, and the shifted round's own `run` promise settles.
 * That promise is the one the dispatch awaits, so it resolves when the turn
 * really ended — an interrupt asks for the ending, it does not stand in for one.
 * The interrupted round stays in the queue as a tombstone until then, so its
 * `result` is consumed by the turn it belongs to instead of being mistaken for a
 * later turn's; and the terminal `complete` — `aborted` for that round — is
 * written at that same moment, before the round settles, so the run the dispatch
 * is watching is already completed by the time its own safety net runs.
 *
 * ## What it reports, and what it never decides
 *
 * Leases, through the sink `openHost` hands over: `turn` while a round is in
 * flight (dropped at its own `result`), `resident-policy` — the mode's
 * statement that the process is meant to sit between turns — and the held-work
 * reasons the CLI's own `Stop` hook reports (`cron` for each `session_crons`
 * entry, `background-task` for each `background_tasks` one), reconciled by id so
 * a firing that changes nothing reports nothing. `resident-policy` is the
 * manager's whole reading of "resident": with it an otherwise empty binding
 * derives `idle` and arms the mode's quiet ceiling, where a per-run host would
 * have closed; the held-work leases are the reading that overrides it — the
 * manager defers the idle close while an unexpired `cron` lease is held, and
 * re-counts the window from that lease's own `expiresAt`. Nothing here decides a
 * close: the resident policy is
 * `supersedeOnNewTurn: false`, so a new turn on a bound session is written to
 * the process that is already there, and the host ends only when the manager
 * says so (a quiet ceiling, the close route, a shutdown).
 *
 * Unlike the per-run driver, this one does emit frames: `HostTurnInput` carries
 * no writer, so a resident turn's writer and runtime context arrive through this
 * class's own `run` entry, which the application dispatch calls. What it does
 * *not* emit is the runtime's interactive half — permission prompts, the
 * notification hook and MCP config loading live in `claude-runtime.provider.js`
 * and are deliberately not duplicated here; a resident turn's tool approvals are
 * therefore resolved by the permission mode alone. That is a known boundary of
 * the mode, not an oversight, and it is why the criterion drives turns whose
 * permission mode needs no prompt.
 *
 * ## Why a fresh start asks for a host rather than a binding
 *
 * `openHost`, not `bindSession`. A session's first resident turn needs the
 * manager to open a process *for that session*, and the manager's `bindSession`
 * is a different question — "which live process can take this conversation" —
 * whose answer for a driver that does not multiplex is a refusal. `openHost`
 * also takes the pid, and the manager accepts a pid only at open time, which is
 * why `run` brings the process up *before* asking for the host record: the
 * record is opened knowing the real pid rather than backfilling it later.
 *
 * The same launch is reachable with no turn at all, through
 * {@link ClaudeResidentHostDriver.startResidentSession}: a user asking for the
 * process before sending anything is asking for the state `run` would have
 * produced, and the only thing missing is the messages. Both entries share one
 * launch path, so "started by the button" and "started by the first turn" cannot
 * come up under different gates or different options.
 *
 * Consumed by `ClaudeProvider`, which mounts it as `IProvider.hostDriver`, and by
 * the criterion in `tests/claude-resident-process.test.ts`, which drives it
 * against the real `claude` binary.

// ------------------------- The Remote Control gate -------------------------
//
// A resident process is launched under `bypassPermissions` (see
// `RESIDENT_PERMISSION_MODE`), and a Claude CLI with the user's own
// `remoteControlAtStartup` on is reachable from *other machines*: Remote Control
// bridges it to Anthropic's backend, where a peer session on another host can
// drive it. A resident process that nobody is watching, running under bypass,
// therefore has a trust boundary that is wider than the Unix user this
// application's whole process model assumes — which is the boundary the proposal
// promised. The gate below is the conservative branch of that promise.
//
// ## Why "refuse" and not "turn it off"
//
// The obvious fix — state `remoteControlAtStartup: false` in the launch's own
// settings and rely on it — is *also* done (see `CLAUDE_REMOTE_CONTROL_FLAGS`),
// but it is not what the refusal rests on, because this build has no reading
// that the flag wins: E9 §9.7 asked the running process what its settings were
// and got no answer at all (`get_settings` never responded), so "the flag
// overrides the user's file" is an assumption rather than a measurement. A gate
// that assumed it would be claiming a security property from an unmeasured
// precedence rule. So the user's *file* is read first, and if it says on, no
// process is started at all: the refusal is a fact this side owns, where the
// precedence is not. The two flags are still passed on every launch that *does*
// happen — defence in depth, and stated as such, never as evidence.
//
// ## What is read, and what is not
//
// User-level settings only: `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/settings.json`. Project-level,
// local and managed settings are **not** read by this gate — that is a known gap,
// not an oversight, and it is recorded as one here because the reading has to be
// honest about its own scope. The file is read at launch time, on the config
// directory the process will actually be given, so what is read is what the
// child sees.
//
// A missing file, a missing key, an unparseable file and a `false` all read as
// "not on": only a literal `true` refuses. That is a deliberate asymmetry — this
// gate does not turn a file it cannot read into a permission it never granted —
// and it is why the reading is three-valued (`null` for "not stated") rather
// than a boolean: a criterion has to be able to tell `false` from "the key was
// not there at all".

   * the CLI's own generation — so the readable title the session earns a moment
   * later never reaches the registry, and every peer keeps addressing it by the
   * machine-shaped name. The `rename_session` control frame is the one verb that
   * moves it without restarting the process (the SDK's `Query` has no method for
   * it; see {@link ClaudeResidentProcess.writeRaw}).
   *
   * Three rules, each one an invariant rather than a preference:
   *
   * - **Never before the title exists.** The frame is built only from a value
   *   read out of the transcript's own `ai-title` entries, so a title that has
   *   not been written cannot be sent. This is not politeness: a rename sent
   *   before generation makes the CLI skip generating a title at all (measured:
   *   the pre-renamed arm's transcript carries `custom-title` rows and zero
   *   `ai-title` rows), so an early frame would destroy the very title it was
   *   trying to mirror.
   * - **Mirror, never invent.** The string is the transcript's `ai-title`
   *   verbatim — no ladder rung, no display name, no placeholder. A transcript
   *   with no generated title leaves this silent rather than naming the process
   *   after its first prompt.
   * - **Once.** `titleMirror.mirrored` latches on the first frame, so the CLI
   *   appending the same title on later rounds does not write a second one.
   *
   * A process launched *with* a title is skipped outright: the CLI adopted that
   * title at startup (`nameSource: "auto"`), so there is nothing derived to
   * correct, and re-mirroring would be this driver naming a process a human or
   * the launch had already named.
   *
   * Called from every stream message, but a window is opened *once per turn* —
   * at the turn's first message, and not again until the next turn's `result`
   * clears the per-turn latch. That cadence is the old one (a window every turn)
   * with the opening moved off the `result` and onto the stream, where the title
   * it is waiting for actually lands: measured on a live session, the CLI writes
   * its `ai-title` row early in the first turn — before the first assistant
   * message — so a window that waited for the `result` left the sidebar's
   * readable name and the address peers dial apart for the whole first turn
   * (362 s on the session that filed this). Opening at the turn's first message
   * costs the same reads as opening at its `result` (one bounded window per turn)
   * and moves the address as soon as the title has settled.
   *
   * A window that finds nothing spends itself rather than polling for the life of
   * the host, and a message that arrives while one is open does not restart it —
   * otherwise a busy turn would buy a read per message instead of one poll per
   * interval.
