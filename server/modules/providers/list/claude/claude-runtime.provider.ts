/**
 * Claude SDK Integration
 *
 * This module provides SDK-based integration with Claude using the @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk.

 *
 * Key features:
 * - Direct SDK integration without child processes
 * - Session management with abort capability
 * - Options mapping between CLI and SDK formats
 * - WebSocket message streaming

 * rather than duplicated so a *resident* host asks the same question the same

 * no new frame kind for elicitation or dialogs: the request travels as the
 * frame's `input` and the caller keeps its own mapping back.
 *
 * Returns the client's own decision object, `{ cancelled: true }` when the wait
 * was aborted, or `null` when it timed out — the three answers the per-run
 * callback has always branched on, so the caller keeps its own branch and its
 * own wording. `permission_resolved` is sent here, before an answer is handed
 * back, for the reason it always was: a mid-run page refresh replays the run
 * buffer, and a prompt with nothing to retract it resurrects.
 *
 * `onCancel` is an extra side effect for a caller that has one — the
 * `permission_cancelled` frame is sent here either way, and both callers (the
 * per-run callback and the resident one) have nothing to add, so its default
 * states the optionality the body's `onCancel?.(reason)` already assumed.

/**
 * The title a session should answer to, or null to hand the CLI none.

 * display name this app has cached on the session row. Handing the cached name
 * over would pin every process to a string the app invented, which is the
 * failure this exists to remove.
 *
 * **It has to be a title, not the reading `summary` hands back.** `summary` is
 * the SDK's ladder over the transcript — `customTitle || aiTitle ||
 * lastPrompt || summaryHint || firstPrompt` — so it answers a question nobody
 * asked here: every session has a value, because the last rung is the session's
 * first prompt verbatim. A session that has not been named yet therefore reads
 * back as something that looks like a title, gets handed to the CLI, and the CLI
 * adopts it as a `custom-title`. That is worse than handing nothing over: a
 * `custom-title` is a rung the app reads as an override, so it outranks the
 * `ai-title` and the session is frozen under its own first prompt —
 * `getSessionInfo().summary` then returns the frozen string forever, and every
 * later round re-hands it. Measured on one machine: 18 of 522 sessions in 48
 * hours had an `ai-title`; the other 504 would each have frozen their first
 * prompt.
 *
 * `customTitle` is the rung that means "this session has a title": the SDK
 * compiles it as `customTitle || aiTitle`, so it is set by a generated title and
 * by a `/rename` alike, and undefined when the ladder falls through to a prompt.
 * That is the rung `readSessionTitle` names as its authority, and it is what a
 * renamed session has too, so a human's word still travels.
 *
 * The title is passed from the *second* round onwards, never on the round that
 * creates the session, because the SDK skips automatic title generation entirely
 * when a title is handed to it: a launch that supplied one at creation would
 * leave the session with nothing to adopt. That falls out of the same gate
 * rather than needing a round counter — the round that creates a session is the
 * round a title is being generated for, so there is none to read yet. A session
 * with no provider id (brand-new, or never resumed by this app) returns before
 * touching the disk, which is every first round.
 *
 * A reading that throws is not a launch failure: a process started without a
 * title is the behaviour that shipped before this, and it is still correct.

 * passed in — so a test can drive it with a fake writer and prove the frames
 * really leave. `stream_delta` is the frame that matters most: it carries the
 * in-place transcript growth the client renders, and a dropped `writer.send`
 * forward would leave the normalizer's own tests green.
 *
 * `parentToolUseId` is copied from the SDK wrapper onto frames that lack one so
 * subagent traffic stays grouped under the tool card that spawned it, and the
 * subagent's own prompt echo is dropped rather than stacked as a second user
 * bubble (see {@link isSubagentPromptEcho}).
 *
 * Frames of the block this event belongs to are stamped with that block's
 * `blockKey` (see {@link trackStreamBlock}) — the streaming fragments, the
 * closing `stream_end`, and the settled record alike. The key is assigned to
 * `msg.blockKey` rather than baked into the normalizer so the history reads that
 * share that normalizer can never carry one.

 * run loop that is the provider-native id the SDK reports), while the activity
 * frames read the phase back under the **app session id** the browser
 * subscribes with (`activity-heartbeat.service.ts` → `readSessionTurn`). Feeding
 * the tracker the provider id while reading it with the app id meant every read
 * missed and reported `idle` for a turn that was genuinely running, which is why
 * the dock stayed on the fallback `Working…` label and never timed. Keying the
 * tracker by the app id is the one id space both ends already share; a caller
