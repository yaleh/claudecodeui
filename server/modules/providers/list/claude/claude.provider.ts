 * so TypeScript infers its destructured parameters from their defaults alone:
 * it presents `sessionId` and `sessionName` as `null | undefined`, even though
 * its own body hands both to a `createNotificationEvent` that takes a string and
 * the runtime's callers pass a session id on every run. The assertion is that
 * true contract, made once here instead of at every call site — and because it
 * is only a widening, a record built from the driver's event still reaches the
 * notification unchanged.
 *
 * `trigger` is widened in for the same reason and is the one field that is
 * genuinely new: the runtime's own call site has no trigger to give (it reports
 * a held background task whose turn it already knew about), so it stays absent
 * there and the notification records `null`. Only the resident driver, which has
 * to work out *what* opened a turn nobody pushed, fills it.

   * serves both of the modes its capabilities declare. `per-run` is the
   * held-input protocol (`createHeldPromptStream` plus the print background-work
   * behavior it enables) that lets a process survive its turn's `result`, which
   * is why Claude's hosts are the ones whose lifetime the session-host layer
   * tracks rather than infers. `resident` is the same protocol held across turns:
   * one CLI reading a never-ending stdin, owned by `ClaudeResidentHostDriver` and
   * reached by the dispatch in `provider-runtime.service`, which routes a turn
   * here only for a session whose stored mode says so.
   *
   * The resident driver composes the per-run one, so the per-run verbs this slot
   * has always served are the same implementation, unchanged — a per-run host
   * opened by anyone still gets that driver's rules.
   *
   * Both drivers' reports go to the notifications the runtime's own run makes, so
   * a held background task and a completed resident turn notify identically
   * however the turn was driven. The event's `userId` is null for a background
   * work report because neither a bind nor a turn carries a connection: the
   * driver reports *what* completed, and the notification layer already treats a
   * missing user as "no per-user preferences to consult".
