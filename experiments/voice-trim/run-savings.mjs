/**
 * The savings reading, taken inside the repo and on the shipping module.
 *
 * The measurement this reproduces has lived out of tree for its whole life:
 * `/data/home/yale/work/tc-verify` holds a 49 MB corpus and a `tools/` directory
 * with its own copy of the pause-cap algorithm. That copy drifted — by AC-113 it
 * disagreed with the module that actually ships on 6 of 16 clips — and a reading
 * taken on a stale copy of the algorithm is worse than no reading, because it
 * looks like evidence. This runner therefore has exactly one source of behaviour:
 * it imports `src/shared/voiceTrim.ts` and reports what that module reports. It
 * decodes WAV headers and does arithmetic on the numbers the module hands back;
 * it does not decide where speech is, how long a pause may be, or when to give
 * up. The uniqueness section at the bottom asserts that mechanically rather than
 * trusting the reader to notice.
 *
 * What it answers: how much shorter does a dictation get, and did any speech go
 * missing while it got shorter. The second half is not decoration — a trimmer
 * that returns an empty buffer saves 100%.
 *
 * Curation, stated up front because it bounds what the numbers mean. The eight
 * fixtures under `fixtures/` are a *ladder*, not a sample: three Chinese
 * occupancy tiers, two English ones, picked so the monotonicity assertion has
 * tiers to move along. The thresholds are therefore pinned to this eight-clip
 * ladder rather than to the corpus it was drawn from — which is the point, since
 * a threshold that needs a 49 MB corpus to evaluate is a threshold that stops
 * being checked the moment the corpus is not there. `VOICE_TRIM_CORPUS` prints
 * the corpus readings beside the ladder's own tier means, so the two can be
 * compared instead of assumed equal.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node experiments/voice-trim/run-savings.mjs             # fixtures only, asserts
 *   VOICE_TRIM_CORPUS=/data/home/yale/work/tc-verify/corpus \
 *     node experiments/voice-trim/run-savings.mjs           # + full-corpus readings
 *
 * Exit 0 only when every assertion holds on the shipping module *and* every
 * control below fails the assertions it is supposed to fail. A control that
 * passes one of them means that assertion cannot tell a real trim from that
 * control, and the run fails rather than report a green it has not earned.
 * Failures are written to stderr, one per line, in the order they were checked.

// line and not a name quoted inside a string. That precision is deliberate and
// it is not the only reader of these files: the suite greps the same directory
// for a declaration of the module's names without anchoring, and therefore also
