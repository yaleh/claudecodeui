/**
 * `--offline`: replay a recorded response instead of calling the recogniser, and `--record`: write
 * that recording.
 *
 * THE ADAPTER'S PARSE, NOT A SECOND ONE
 *
 * A replayed entry yields the SHIPPING adapter's own `parseTranscriptionResponse` output. This
 * file does not read `text` off a body anywhere — if it did, a criterion built on it would be
 * measuring this file rather than the app, which is the failure mode the whole command line exists
 * to avoid. What this file owns is only the transport side: which recorded entry answers, and what
 * "no entry answers" means.
 *
 * TOLERANCE IS PART OF THE RECORDING, NOT A PROPERTY OF THE REPLAY
 *
 * The two shipping paths already disagree about a body that is not JSON — the direct path reports
 * a failure, the proxy hands the body back as the transcript. A recording therefore carries BOTH
 * readings of the same bytes (`expect.strict` and `expect.lenient`), and a replay names which one
 * it is reproducing. That is what lets one replay mechanism cover the divergence rather than
 * picking a side.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE FALLS BACK
 *
 * An entry that is not recorded is `offline-miss`: not the injected transport, not the network. The
 * injected transport is a parameter of `recordedResponse` on purpose, so that the control suite has
 * one line to move when it asks whether "the replay did not go online" can be false.
