/**
 * `--dry-run`: the request this CLI would put on the wire, printed with both of its secrets taken

 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS A READING RATHER THAN A PRINT-OUT
 *
 *   · the request is BUILT BY THE SHIPPING ADAPTER (`createTranscriptionRequest`), not by this
 *     file. A dry run that spelled its own multipart would be printing a description of a request
 *     the app would not send, which is the failure this whole CLI exists to avoid;
 *   · the injected transport is NEVER CALLED, and `neverSend` below is the one line that could.
 *     The control suite rewrites exactly that line and requires the criterion to go red on the
 *     transport's own call log — so "a dry run sends nothing" is falsifiable rather than asserted;
 *   · two things are redacted and they are two different kinds of thing, so they get two named
 *     functions: a CREDENTIAL (a secret that must not be echoed, decided by the NAME and never by
 *     the value) and the AUDIO BYTES (a payload that must not be echoed, and whose DIGEST must be
 *     — a redaction that printed nothing at all would be indistinguishable from an implementation
 *     that never opened the file).
 *
 * The body shape is read off whatever the adapter built rather than assumed to be multipart: if
 * the wire protocol changes its body, this report changes with it instead of going quietly stale.
